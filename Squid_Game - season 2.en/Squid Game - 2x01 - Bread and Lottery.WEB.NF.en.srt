00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,527
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,530
You've got no place to go.

3
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,169
Don't hide like a sneaky little rat.
Show yourself.

4
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,296
You should have gotten on that plane.

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,507
You will regret your decision.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,510
I'm going to find you.

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,305
No matter what it takes.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,568
Where to, sir?

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,325
To Seoul, please.

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,910
All right.

11
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm sorry, but...

12
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,612
could you give me five minutes?

13
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,738
Jun-ho.

14
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,035
Jun-ho, can you hear me?

15
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,583
Doctor! I need a doctor in here!

16
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,628
My son just opened his eyes!

17
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,505
In-ho.

2 YEARS LATER

21
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,040
What the hell?

22
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,961
You're not wearing a helmet.
Your license, please.

23
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,631
Damn it. Isn't this entrapment?

24
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,800
Hiding to catch people is shady.

25
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,261
You want to squeeze money
out of broke citizens?

26
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,345
Your license, please.

27
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
Hold on.

28
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,229
Look, can't you just let us go?
I'm wearing one.

29
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,939
No, ma'am.

30
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,944
Hey, you're really hot.

31
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,863
I could charge you with obstruction.

32
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,532
You're a tough cookie.

33
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,958
Come on, get in here.

34
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,296
Damn, great picture.

35
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,549
The fine for not wearing a helmet
is 20,000 won. Pay it on time.

36
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,426
Hey, can I post this picture online?

37
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,803
Are you on Instagram?
Let's follow each other!

38
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,389
Where are you going?

39
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,058
Hey! Where are you going? What about me?

40
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,771
You can ask that stupid pig
for a ride in his patrol car!

41
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,483
Hey!

42
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,277
You asshole!

43
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,278
Damn it!

44
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,614
Hwang Jun-ho!

45
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,163
Is this why you transferred here?
To be called a "stupid pig"?

46
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,540
Chief.

47
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,002
Do you like vinegar on these?

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,839
It's been so long, I can't quite remember.

49
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,677
Jun-ho, stop wasting your time out here.
Come back to the Major Crimes Division.

50
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,431
Wait, not on the onions.
Just on the pickled radish, right?

51
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,061
For God's sake, are you still brooding?

52
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,772
Look, I've tried.

53
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,232
I've made enough appeals
to the authorities,

54
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,651
and I had the coast guard
search the area for days.

55
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,905
I know. Just eat your noodles
before they get soggy.

56
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,823
Listen.

57
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,160
I want to believe you.

58
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,453
No, I do believe you.

59
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,539
But we never got those photos
you said you sent.

60
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,377
Your phone is at the bottom of the sea,
and you don't know where that island is.

61
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,631
Those games you said you saw,
where people got killed?

62
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,175
I've tried to make
the higher-ups believe it,

63
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,428
but there's just not enough evidence.

64
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,641
The only evidence is
the untraceable bullet in your shoulder.

65
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,687
And let me remind you, smart-ass.
You went rogue with a gun

66
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,816
and suddenly turned up at death's door.

67
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,734
I haven't told you this before,

68
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,237
but when you woke up,

69
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,615
they were ready to fire you,
and I went out of my way to stop them.

70
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,409
Right, thank you.

71
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,246
I'll be forever indebted to you, sir.

72
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,790
You sarcastic little shit.

73
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,543
Look, we're the police.

74
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,963
Firemen fight fire with water,
and the police--

75
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,215
"Fight crime with evidence."

76
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,636
I know. That's why I work in traffic now.

77
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,349
You see,
we always have clear evidence here.

78
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,686
Running red lights,
speeding, not wearing a helmet...

79
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,148
Our evidence is there in pictures.
No one can dispute it.

80
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,070
Jun-ho, do you really not remember

81
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,906
who shot you?

82
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,077
No.

83
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,160
In-ho.

84
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,206
Come with me.

85
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,459
In-ho, why...

86
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,012
Where are we going?

87
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
Look, there's a motel here.

88
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,599
Here?

89
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,518
What?

90
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,146
Excuse me.

91
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,483
Is anyone there?

92
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,277
Are you open or what?

93
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
Hello?

94
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,907
Babe, do we have to stay here?

95
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,992
Looks like a dump.

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,705
The lights are off too. Are they closed?

97
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,167
Good. No lights means the rooms are full.
Let's go someplace else.

98
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,003
How do you know that?

99
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,922
Who told you?

100
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,424
Do you have to ask? I just know.

101
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,594
You just know?
What are you, a motel expert?

102
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,472
Seriously? You're a dick.

103
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,267
-"A dick"...
- You said you liked how I knew everything.

104
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,896
Just tell me how you knew.
Did your ex-boyfriend tell you?

105
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,939
Get lost!

106
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,983
Why can't you answer me?

107
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,851
Who's there?

108
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,134
Player 456.

109
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,054
Looking for these?

110
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,912
It's me.

111
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,967
I got you some food and medicine.
How are you feeling?

112
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,553
I'm fine.

113
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,431
Come on, you don't look any better.

114
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,767
I told you not to overdo it, didn't I?

115
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,770
You'll burn yourself out
before you find that guy.

116
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,689
How did it go?

117
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,443
We checked all the subway stations
on Lines 1 to 4 today.

118
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,196
But again, nothing.

119
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,158
Time of search?

120
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,035
From 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

121
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,331
We took one-hour lunch and dinner breaks.
We take turns eating.

122
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,838
What if he knows you're onto him
and he's gone somewhere else?

123
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,967
We've been searching for two years
but found no trace of him.

124
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:04,390
Tomorrow, get more men, extend the search.
From the first train to the last.

125
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,560
Check all the lines at the same time.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,395
All the lines at the same time?

127
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,775
Pulling off something that extensive

128
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,486
would mean shelling out
a ton of money on staff.

129
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,627
I was approached by him three years ago,
around this time of year.

130
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,882
If the game is still going on,

131
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,010
he's recruiting players right now.

132
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,310
It may take another year
if we don't find him now.

133
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,482
Yeah... Okay, I got it.

134
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,569
I... I'll make sure to find him this time.

135
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,070
I promise.

136
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
- Woo-seok.
- Yeah.

137
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,749
From tomorrow,
we're going to need more people.

138
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,211
What? But how many more?

139
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,463
Just call everyone you know.

140
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,300
- But--
- Also, we start at 6 a.m.

141
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,094
So don't stay out drinking.
Go home and get some sleep.

142
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,931
At 6 a.m.? Who'd play ddakji at--

143
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,352
Come on. Boss. I've thought about it,
but it just doesn't make any sense--

144
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,897
No. I'm sure something is going on.

145
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,776
As you know, most of the people
who owe me money

146
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,694
have disappeared over the last few years.

147
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,738
- I never got any money back...
- Okay.

148
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,866
So you think everyone who owes you money
was taken to some island

149
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,244
and got killed playing kiddie games.
That sounds--

150
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,287
Goddamnit, I barely believe a word,

151
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,456
but I'm doing this for the money!

152
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,045
If Seong Gi-hun hadn't come to me himself

153
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,131
to pay off his debt
and hired me for this job,

154
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,218
I couldn't have paid you all
or kept the business running.

155
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,135
I know that, but--

156
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,013
Then shut up and search
with your eyes wide open.

157
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,931
Okay.

158
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,851
If we find that bastard with the ddakji,

159
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,770
we will get a one-billion won reward.

160
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,230
One billion?

161
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,567
That's right.
Do you want to believe his story now?

162
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,776
- But--
- Tell you what.

163
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,072
Whoever finds the guy,
I'll give you half the money. Okay?

164
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,533
- So 500 million?
- That's right!

165
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,368
Well, what are we waiting for?

166
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,620
Five hundred million won!

167
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,533
Captain.

168
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,451
Hello.

169
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,162
How have you been?

170
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,497
Same old, same old.

171
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,879
When the weather is good, I catch fish.
When it's bad, I catch a buzz.

172
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,300
You still look great for someone
who drinks every day, Captain Park.

173
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,636
Save it and put this on.

174
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,013
We've got a mystery island to find.

175
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,938
Where can I take you today, Captain Hwang?

176
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,232
We've checked pretty much everywhere
over the past year and a half,

177
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,361
but you want to keep going,
and I don't know where else to take you.

178
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,822
Where are you, mystery island?

179
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,037
Some places couldn't be checked properly
because of the conditions or tide changes.

180
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,373
I've narrowed them down.

181
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,834
Let's try here today.

182
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,795
Sure thing, Captain Hwang.

183
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,841
Man, why did I have to save a drowning man

184
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,012
and put myself through all this trouble?
I pity myself.

185
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,106
SUNSHINE CAPITAL

186
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,190
All right. Listen up.

187
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,818
The person we're looking for

188
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,028
is this guy.

189
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,032
He's tall, probably over 6 ft.

190
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:36,704
He's a good-looking fella in a nice suit,
with a briefcase in hand.

191
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,414
And in that briefcase,

192
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,042
he's got stacks of money and ddakji.

193
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,423
He plays ddakji with strangers
at subway stations, and afterwards...

194
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,635
he gives them a card like this.

195
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,387
- I can't see.
- What does it say?

196
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:58,559
The moment you spot someone like that,
call the number we gave you.

197
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,645
Take a picture.

198
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,775
- Hold on, I can't see.
- Move your head.

199
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,653
- Please move!
- Just a little bit!

200
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,197
All right. Are you done?

201
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,616
Here are your designated areas.

202
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,951
Group 1, Lines 1 and 2.

203
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,746
Group 2, Lines 3 and 4.
Group 3, Lines 5 and 6.

204
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,873
Group 4, Lines 7 and 8. And Group 5,

205
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,876
the Gyeongui-Jungang Line
and the Airport Railroad.

206
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,878
From the first train to the last,

207
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,591
search the stations one by one.

208
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,217
Every single one of them.

209
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,763
Do not skip a single station.

210
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,930
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

211
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,767
Now, after searching each station,

212
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,729
take a picture to prove it
and send it to the group chat.

213
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,607
Otherwise, you won't get paid.
Are we clear?

214
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,108
- Yes, sir!
- One last thing.

215
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,652
The team that finds the guy

216
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,239
gets a bonus of 500 million won.

217
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,995
Damn, 500 million? Really?

218
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,176
After you, sir.

219
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,723
Let's go make 500 million won!

220
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
We're heading to the subway stations.

221
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,734
I'll be on standby at the usual spot.
Keep me posted.

222
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,735
Okay.

223
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,138
SEARCHING YONGDU STATION

224
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,850
SEARCHING OKSU STATION

225
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,237
Have you seen a guy like this?
He's tall and...

226
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,781
- A man in a suit, with a briefcase.
- I'm not sure.

227
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,286
If he flips mine like this,
it means I lose, right?

228
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,996
So I get slapped.

229
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,039
Like this. Have you seen it?

230
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,125
A man in a suit
slapping people in the face.

231
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,553
- Excuse me.
- Who are you?

232
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,679
Sorry.

233
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,391
Excuse me. Let me take a quick look.

234
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,601
Hey, it's all right.

235
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,686
Just a quick check.

236
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,315
Excuse me.

237
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,941
Who are you?

238
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,984
It'll be quick.

239
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,904
How did it go?

240
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,953
Right here.

241
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,705
Smile.

242
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,916
- One.
- Look serious.

243
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,585
HANGANGJIN STATION CLEAR

244
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,552
- We need a photo.
- Yeah.

245
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,729
TODAY'S SEARCH HAS ENDED

246
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,528
Captain Hwang, we're heading back now.

247
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,571
Yeah.

248
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,391
We've got to eat something first.

249
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,660
Hold on tight!

250
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,335
For God's sake.

251
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,888
Time for another selfie.
Let's take one now.

252
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,724
Oh, man.

253
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,851
TODAY'S SEARCH HAS ENDED

254
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,862
I told you this was a terrible idea
in this weather.

255
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,822
There are whirlpools in that area.

256
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,867
No one ever really goes there,
not even the big boats.

257
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,328
We're lucky we didn't capsize.

258
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,664
We almost joined the mermaids
looking for that island.

259
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,709
I'm sorry.

260
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,837
Why did I have to pull you
out of the water that day

261
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,256
and end up risking my life
doing this shit for nothing?

262
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
I'm forever grateful.

263
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,594
Do you know how many islands there are

264
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,971
within a 6-mile radius
of where I found you?

265
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,306
There are hundreds.

266
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,141
And the currents are strong out there.

267
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,728
There's no telling how far
you drifted with that buoy.

268
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,357
You can't even remember which island
you fell from,

269
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,443
let alone the island
where they play the games.

270
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,737
So how in the world would we find it?

271
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,407
You're right. It's time to stop.

272
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,494
We've done enough.

273
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,210
You say that now,
but I know you'll be back next week.

274
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,506
Thank you for saving my life

275
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,800
and helping me look for the island.

276
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,135
I promise I'll find a way to repay you.

277
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,597
You don't have to do that.

278
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,354
I'm sad to hear that
you won't be coming back.

279
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,606
I'll come visit from time to time.

280
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,153
All right.
Come and catch squid with me, okay?

281
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,365
It's so hard to find good crew members
these days.

282
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,159
I'll pay you more than
what you make as an officer.

283
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,787
Oh, how much?

284
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:38,291
Well, let's talk about that over a drink
when we get back.

285
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
There's the port.

286
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,297
The doors are opening.

287
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,640
The doors are closing.

288
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,975
There.

289
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,317
You've got to be kidding me with this.

290
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
Even construction workers
get proper food these days.

291
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,698
This is just... Damn.

292
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,366
You little...

293
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,287
You're making easy money down here
in the middle of summer.

294
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,747
Count your blessings.

295
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,209
You idiot.
Go work at a construction site then.

296
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,632
Seriously though.

297
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:31,011
How much of Seong Gi-hun's story
do you actually believe?

298
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,764
We've been searching every subway station
in the city all summer,

299
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,266
but no one's ever seen the guy.

300
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,560
Here's the thing.

301
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,189
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

302
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,691
Seong Gi-hun may be crazy,

303
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:50,447
but he wouldn't waste billions
looking for someone who doesn't exist.

304
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
He's onto something for sure.

305
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:58,205
Come on, boss. We've been searching
these stations for the past two years.

306
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:01,291
Not days, years. Two whole years.

307
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,296
My wife says I should find that bastard,
get myself into the game,

308
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,007
and bring home 45.6 billion won.

309
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,385
If someone were playing ddakji down here,
we would've found him--

310
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes!

311
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,055
Hello?

312
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,099
We've found the guy. It's him.

313
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,477
Are you sure?

314
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,188
The ddakji, slapping, and money.
It's just like you said.

315
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,191
He's handing over the card now.

316
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,487
Where are you?

317
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,864
Jonggak Station, but he's leaving.

318
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,991
I'm on my way.

319
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,160
Follow him carefully,
and keep me updated on his location.

320
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,205
Stay on him until I get there.

321
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,082
I got it. I'll be in touch.

OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

324
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:59,451
The phone is off.
You will be directed to voicemail...

325
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,262
Ms. Kim Jun-hee.

326
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,058
Is there a Ms. Kim Jun-hee here?

327
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,314
Ms. Park Mi-yeong.

328
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,231
- Yes.
- Yes.

329
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,524
We're ready for you.

330
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,533
All of them?

331
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,622
I'm sorry? A hundred scratchers?

332
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,834
Good dreams last night?

333
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,242
Hey. He's gone into Tapgol Park.

334
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,493
I'm heading there now.

335
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,954
Do not approach him. Wait for me.

336
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,831
Okay. Hurry up.

337
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,273
Excuse me, sir.

338
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,114
Hello.

339
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,785
You seem to be struggling,
living a life with no future.

340
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,706
I have a little gift for you today.

341
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,583
A gift?

342
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,002
What is it?

343
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,768
You can only have one.

344
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:34,022
Bread, or lottery. You have to choose one.

345
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,011
SORRY!

346
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,639
You lost.

347
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,267
The coin, please.

348
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,331
- Woo-seok.
- Yeah.

349
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,208
What the hell do you think he's doing?

350
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,710
I don't know.

351
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,839
Maybe he's a good guy. I'm confused.

352
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,907
SORRY!

353
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,367
Damn it.

354
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,719
Damn it.

355
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,815
Damn it! Fucking hell.

356
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,290
How come he's not giving us one?

357
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,209
Beats me.
Man, I had a lucky dream last night.

358
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,938
What is he doing?

359
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,692
Why would you throw away
perfectly good food like that?

360
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,451
I gave you a chance,
and you made your choice.

361
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,997
I'm not the one who threw these away.

362
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,792
It was you, ladies and gentlemen.

363
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,263
What's wrong with him?

364
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,267
Plate number 2071, pull over.

365
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,603
Plate number 2071, pull over now.

366
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,289
You take this one.

367
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,790
Me?

368
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,793
They'll either beg you to let it slide

369
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,171
or complain about us hiding
to give people tickets.

370
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,425
Don't be unkind,
but don't listen to them go on about it.

371
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,094
Just be polite and professional. Got it?

372
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,846
Yes, sir.

373
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,569
Sir, you were going over the speed limit.
Can I see your license?

374
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,213
Taxi!

375
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,299
Come on!

376
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,137
Please follow that orange cab over there.

377
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,889
- What?
- Shit.

378
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,308
I'll pay double if you catch up with it.

379
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,392
All right!

380
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,152
Where are you? Are you coming?

381
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,530
I'll be there soon.

382
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,406
This guy is a total nutcase.

383
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,202
He's in a cab now.
I'll keep you updated, but hurry!

384
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,453
I got it.

385
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,168
The fine for speeding is 60,000 won.
Make sure--

386
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,388
That was quick.
Did you do everything right?

387
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,392
Well, he just took the ticket
and drove off without saying anything.

388
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,603
That's suspicious. Did you run his ID?

389
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,939
Nothing came up.

390
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,275
I don't know what he does,

391
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,945
but he had a lot of cell phones
and tablets in his car.

392
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,577
SEONG GI-HUN
NO CRIMINAL RECORD FOUND

393
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,626
- Turn right here.
- All right.

394
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,089
Boss, he's getting out!

395
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,007
He just got out.

396
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,758
I'll send the address.
Call when you arrive.

397
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,051
You can drop us off here.

398
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,052
Okay.

399
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,890
Here. Thank you.

400
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,684
Where's Seong?

401
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,102
He'll be here in ten minutes.

402
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,986
Hey, we might lose him if we wait.
Let's just get him by ourselves.

403
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,947
- By ourselves?
- That's right. Are you scared?

404
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,657
It's two against one.

405
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,409
Don't be a coward now you're married.

406
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,120
It's just that
something seems off with that guy.

407
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,497
Besides, Seong told us
to wait until he gets here.

408
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,626
But what if we lose him?
What if Seong doesn't give us the money?

409
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,544
Woo-seok. It's a billion won!

410
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,299
You'll give me half, right?

411
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,552
Don't you trust me?
I officiated your wedding, for God's sake.

412
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:07,642
Come on.

413
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,899
- Hey, you! Stop!
- Stop!

414
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,194
Hey, you!

415
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,823
Boss!

416
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,706
Come on! Come at me, damn it!

417
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,793
Woo-seok...

418
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,091

Mr. Seong.

421
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,855
Please help me.

422
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,109
I need to find my brother.

423
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,198
I'm sorry.

424
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,578
I'm not in a position
to help anyone at the moment.

The person you have called

You will be directed to voicemail
and charged after the beep.

430
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,803
MR. KIM

431
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,967
It looks like the car you're asking about

432
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,595
is currently being rented by a company.

433
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,264
A company? What's the name?

434
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,103
It says, "Sunshine Capital."

435
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,980
The address, please.

436
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,781
You're going to play a game now.

437
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:56,203
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One.
I trust you know the rules.

438
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,498
You form a shape with each hand,
then take one away.

439
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,792
The game is decided
by the remaining hands.

440
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,629
Of course,
there's a penalty for the loser.

441
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,259
I'm sure you've seen this in movies.
It's called Russian Roulette.

442
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,099
I'll place one bullet into a revolver
and close it.

443
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,644
I'll point the gun at the loser's head
and pull the trigger.

444
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,774
Your odds of death are 1 in 6.

445
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,861
Your odds of survival are 5 in 6.

446
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,496
Not that bad, right?

447
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,419
All right. Now, let's play. On my count.

448
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,679
Rock, paper, scissors.

449
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,394
You didn't play.

450
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,272
You broke the rules for the first round.

451
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,191
Disqualified.

452
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,419
Now, let's play again.

453
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,172
Rock, paper, scissors.

454
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,132
Minus one.

455
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,109
Don't be so nervous.

456
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,571
Like I said,
your odds of survival are 5 in 6.

457
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,616
Let's play again.

458
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,621
Rock, paper, scissors.

459
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,539
Minus one.

460
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,840
It's getting a little boring, isn't it?

461
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,303
Let's reverse the odds now, shall we?

462
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,471
Your odds of survival are now 1 in 6.

463
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,807
Please don't...

464
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,019
Your odds of death are 5 in 6.

465
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,983
All right, let's play again.

466
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,485
Let's speed it up, okay?

467
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:42,828
Rock, paper, scissors. Minus one.

468
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:43,912
Rock, paper, scissors!

469
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,824
Minus one.

470
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,672
Too bad. You didn't take one away.

471
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,895
Disqualified.

472
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,843
Congratulations on your win.

473
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,223
Now, can we have a talk?

474
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,479
SUNSHINE CAPITAL

475
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,118
That's right.
The boss hasn't come back yet.

476
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,247
Seong says he and Woo-seok

477
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,041
were following that guy with the ddakji
when he lost contact with them.

478
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,584
How the hell would I know?

479
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,087
Anyway, gather everyone
and go to Daebang Station.

480
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,130
I'll pick up some weapons from the office.

481
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,201
Yeah.

482
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,706
I said Daebang Station, you idiot.
Not Sindaebang.

483
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,417
Don't make me
keep repeating myself, blockhead.

484
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,253
That's what I said! Call everyone now!

485
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,672
Goddamn idiot.

486
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,455
IOU

487
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,539
SEONG GI-HUN

488
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,929
CERTIFICATE OF BUSINESS REGISTRATION
PINK MOTEL

489
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,182
I found bloodstains there.

490
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,810
I'm sure they didn't get far
from that alley.

491
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:02,439
Check all the CCTV and dashcam footage
you can collect from the area

492
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,275
and keep asking around.
I'll join you soon.

493
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,934
It's been a long time, Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

494
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,322
You should've gotten
on that plane that day.

495
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,161
I changed my mind when I saw you.

496
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,711
It looks like
you've been trying hard to find me.

497
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,964
I wanted to thank you.

498
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,510
Thank me?

499
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,892
For inviting me to the game.

500
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,229
I won

501
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,774
and made it out with a fortune.

502
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,196
The decent thing to do
would be to thank you for it.

503
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,325
I'm just a messenger
who delivers invitations.

504
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,203
Who had you deliver those invitations?

505
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,333
Let me meet him. I have something to say.

506
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,463
Give me the message,
and I'll pass it along.

507
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:53,050
It's not something I can discuss
with an underling like you.

508
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,428
You prey on people
who are hanging by a thread

509
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,097
and con them at subway stations.

510
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,935
Someone like you wouldn't be able
to understand what I'm trying to say.

511
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,314
Mr. Seong.

512
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,196
How do you think I got to where I am now?

513
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,868
I don't care how you became their dog.

514
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,039
Bring me your master.

515
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,257
I used to work in the games
when I was younger.

516
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:39,262
I removed and burned the bodies
of countless people like you.

517
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,849
"These things aren't human."

518
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,146
"They're just trash,
utterly useless in this world."

519
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,442
I kept telling myself that
and worked hard for a few years.

520
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,862
Then they gave me a gun.

521
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,742
It felt pretty good.

522
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,164
Like my existence was acknowledged
for the first time in my life.

523
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,087
I don't know which year it was,
but one day,

524
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,134
I was about to shoot a man
who had lost a game.

525
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,848
The guy seemed familiar.

526
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,226
Guess who it was.

527
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,521
My dad.

528
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,445
My dad was suddenly
standing right in front of me.

529
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,702
He was in tears,
desperately begging me to spare his life.

530
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,833
I shot him right in the middle
of his forehead, and realized,

531
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,543
"Ah."

532
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,840
"I'm cut out for this job."

533
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,096
Whether you shoot people in there

534
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,893
or con them outside,
it doesn't change anything.

535
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,481
You have always been...

536
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,195
nothing more than their dog.

537
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,197
Mr. Seong.

538
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:27,329
Do you think you're special
because you won the game?

539
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,124
Someone like you

540
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,252
could never know...

541
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,173
or understand

542
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,929
how I made it out of there alive.

543
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,308
And how it feels...

544
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,063
to play the games.

545
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,035
Let's play a game.

546
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,928
I'm sure you've seen this in the movies.
It's called Russian Roulette.

547
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:29,140
Usually, you place one bullet in the gun,
spin the cylinder,

548
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,226
and pull the trigger.

549
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:37,357
And before the next round,
you spin the cylinder again.

550
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,611
It resets the odds back to 1 in 6.

551
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,073
But I'd like to make
this game a little more serious.

552
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,952
Because you're special, Mr. Seong.

553
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,829
Cut to the chase.

554
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,751
We'll take turns pulling the trigger
without spinning the cylinder again.

555
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,422
The bullet will be fired within
six attempts, and the game will be over.

556
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,508
What do you say?

557
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,275
I've always wondered

558
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,737
how you made it out of there alive.

559
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,200
For one thing,
you were even terrible at ddakji.

560
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,038
What's the matter?

561
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,374
Is your mind starting to race?

562
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,838
Now your odds of death are 1 in 2.

563
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,882
That's pretty high indeed.

564
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,261
I'm sure you're afraid.
Lots going through your mind.

565
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,181
Let me guess
what you're thinking right now.

566
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,102
"The gun is in my hand."

567
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,149
"Screw the rules.
Pull the trigger once or twice,

568
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,192
and I can blow this guy's face off."

569
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,571
Isn't that right?

570
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,783
If you want to meet the person
you mentioned earlier,

571
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,160
the key is in my pocket.

572
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,121
You can simply shoot me
with that gun and take it.

573
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,707
But I'll have you admit one thing.

574
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,049
That you're a piece of trash,
just like everyone else.

575
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:57,056
A piece of trash who got lucky
and made it out of the dumpster.

576
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,102
What's the matter?

577
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,605
Is your mind starting to race?

578
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,732
That's right.

579
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,735
Screw the rules.

580
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,114
Now, with a single pull of the trigger,

581
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,993
you could kill me.

582
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,454
But...

583
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,708
I'll have you admit one thing.

584
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,463
You put a mask over your face

585
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,133
and do whatever your master says.

586
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,137
You run, bark,

587
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,599
and wag your tail for them.

588
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,855
You're nothing more than their dog.

589
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:13,187
