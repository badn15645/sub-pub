1
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,889
If you want to meet the person
you mentioned earlier,

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,891
the key is in my pocket.

3
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,659
Please don't kill me.
I'm sorry for everything. Please!

4
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,035
Where is Seong Gi-hun?

5
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,328
Room 410!

6
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,597
Police. Hands above your head!

7
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,407
Seong Gi-hun.

8
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,784
You are under arrest
on suspicion of murder.

9
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,870
You have the right to an attorney,

10
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,246
and you have the right to--

11
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,086
Who are you?

12
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,134
Are... Are you Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

13
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,470
I've been helping Mr. Kim
look for the man with the ddakji.

14
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,181
My name is Choi Woo-seok.

15
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,351
We've been sending you pictures
from the subway stations every day!

16
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,270
Don't you remember?

17
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,026
We've never met in person,

18
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,737
but I've heard
a lot about you from my boss.

19
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:20,325
He said you were a great man
who came to settle your debt voluntarily.

20
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,911
He said he'd never seen anyone like you...

21
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,413
That bastard.

22
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,209
Did you kill him, Mr. Seong?

23
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,839
You goddamn son of a bitch!

24
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,219
That bastard...

25
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,224
That bastard killed the boss.

26
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,649
I played two rocks by mistake.

27
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:57,570
He had paper and scissors.
All he had to do was pick paper.

28
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,114
But he didn't.

29
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,784
Like a fool...

30
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,869
OCTOBER 31 MIDNIGHT
CLUB HDH

31
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,759
SQUID GAME 2

32
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,808
EPISODE 2
HALLOWEEN PARTY

33
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
Excuse me!

34
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,165
Hey!

35
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,959
Wake up!

36
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,215
Open the window.

37
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,768
What are you doing here?

38
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,855
I work here.

39
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,523
I have to be here early tomorrow.

40
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,526
Doesn't mean you can
sleep out here in your car.

41
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll get in trouble
if my superiors find out.

42
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,906
I think I've seen you here before.

43
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,701
I'm sorry. I'll move my car tomorrow.

44
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,911
There won't be a next time.

45
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,998
Otherwise, I'll have to report you.

46
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay.

47
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
Detective Hwang Jun-ho.

48
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,609
Now I remember.

49
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,112
You came to see me
at my house once before.

50
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,656
We've met twice.

51
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,868
Once in front of your house, and again...

52
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,662
on that island.

53
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,375
Do you remember?
The night of the ruckus in the dorm.

54
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,294
The masked men went in to stop it.

55
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,590
Were you one of them?

56
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,134
I snuck in there in disguise
to find my brother.

57
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,220
How can I believe you?

58
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,140
One of the masked men asked you
about someone named Hwang In-ho.

59
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,060
Player 456.

60
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,687
Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?

61
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,526
We do not know each other's names.

62
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,653
That was me.

63
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,947
Hwang In-ho is my brother.

64
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,953
Who's the man you killed?

65
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,541
He's a recruiter
who finds players for the game.

66
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,710
But I didn't kill him.

67
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,550
He simply lost the game.

68
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,221
Are you still a part of that game?

69
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,474
I'm trying to put an end to it.

70
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,559
How?

71
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm going to find that guy first.

72
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,273
The overseer of the game,
who worked for Oh Il-nam.

73
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,651
Do you know who he is?

74
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,697
The masked men call him Captain.

75
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,948
Did you see his face?

76
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,830
No, I didn't see his face.
He was wearing a black mask.

77
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,002
How do you plan on finding him?

78
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,881
This is the invitation he sent.

79
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,263
If you find him, what next?

80
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Kill him?

81
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,478
Killing him
will not put an end to the game.

82
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,190
Before Oh Il-nam died, he said

83
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,360
he created the game for his clients.

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,403
That's right.

85
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,364
There are people they call the VIPs.

86
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,241
I saw one of them.

87
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,119
Let me go.

88
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,705
I'll help you find them.

89
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,375
Mr. Seong. You can't trust cops.

90
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,671
I've never seen cops
helping people like us.

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,888
I'm sorry about your brother.
But you should forget about it.

92
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,556
Can you forget?

93
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,143
The people who died on that island?

94
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,731
I saw things that you didn't.

95
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,150
I can help you...

96
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,987
with what you're trying to do.

97
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
Please reconsider, Mr. Seong.

98
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,876
I once got scammed and lost all my money.

99
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,379
I was furious,
so I roughed him up a little.

100
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,172
It wasn't even that bad,

101
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,717
but the cops only arrested me
and told me to settle with him.

102
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,219
But with what money?

103
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,680
That asshole took everything.

104
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,684
You know what's crazy?
I went to prison, and he got away with it.

105
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,811
Since then, I've never trusted cops...

106
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,400
The money...

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,901
Mr. Seong.

108
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
So it's true that you won the game?

109
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,249
It's blood money
for all those people who died there.

110
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,130
I'm going to use it
to fight those bastards.

111
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,094
If you help me,
I'll give you as much as you want.

112
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm not doing this for money.

113
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
Me neither.

114
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,061
That bastard killed my boss
right in front of me.

115
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,481
He was like a brother to me.
He even officiated my wedding.

116
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,319
I'm going to find the fat cats,
tie them up,

117
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,779
make them play Rock, Paper, Scissors
and shoot them dead.

118
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,408
They have armed forces on that island.

119
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,077
We can't fight them with a few pistols.

120
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,542
These are what I've collected so far.

121
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,215
Are they real?
Where did you get all these?

122
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:38,220
Man, Mr. Seong. So you've got a plan!

123
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,973
I want you to gather people
we can join forces with.

124
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,892
Sure, don't worry.

125
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,645
I know some men
who are good at that stuff.

126
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,564
These are K2s, aren't they?

127
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,400
I haven't seen one
since I was in the military.

128
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,029
I'm guessing they're black market.

129
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,531
Do they even work?

130
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,354
Come and practice whenever you can.

131
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
Also,

132
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,860
I suggest that you quit your current job.

133
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,086
God, it's hot. Turn up the AC!

134
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,007
Man, why is the AC here so weak? Damn it.

135
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,762
- Can somebody ask to get it fixed?
- The weather is insane.

136
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,390
- I want to go home.
- What are you doing after work?

137
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,392
- Want to grab a beer?
- Sounds good.

138
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,729
- I'm in.
- A new place opened nearby.

139
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,982
- I'm exhausted.
- That was rough.

140
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,338
Bunny, this is for you.

141
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,982
Bunny, does it hurt here?

142
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,445
It's too hot for this, man.

143
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,826
I can't breathe in this fucking pig head.
Is it just me?

144
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,462
Na-yeon!

145
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,965
Na-yeon.

146
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,591
Na-yeon.

147
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,179
Na-yeon.
I told you not to go into random places.

148
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,224
Daddy!

149
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,645
Don't cry. I'm sorry, guys.

150
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
You're okay. Daddy is here.

151
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,323
When did she get out of the hospital?

152
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,576
Who is she?

153
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,956
You know the artists
who draw people's portraits in the park?

154
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,042
That guy is one of them,
and she's his daughter.

155
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,211
Is she sick?

156
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,882
Well, I hear she has blood cancer.

157
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,426
Apparently, she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

158
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,553
but it's not easy to get one.

SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

160
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,479
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

161
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,155
Cheol!

162
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,615
Grandma.

163
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,580
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

164
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,582
I had a burger with my friends.

165
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,211
That's not enough.
I steamed some sweet potatoes.

166
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,422
Sweet potatoes? But I'm full.

167
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,882
Drink some sikhye then.

168
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,389
The woman next to Sae-byeok is her mom.

169
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,519
She was recently released from
a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province.

170
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,397
How is she doing?

171
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,233
There was a tuberculosis outbreak
in her prison,

172
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,527
but she never received proper treatment.

173
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,238
She won't be able to move for a while.

174
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,200
Please just get her here
as soon as possible.

175
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,288
I've got the best experts ready
in China and North Korea.

176
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,334
As soon as she recovers,
we'll get her moving.

177
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,504
I can give you more money
if that's what you need.

178
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,172
No.

179
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,299
You've already given me enough money.

180
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,265
After last time, I owe it to Sae-byeok.

181
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,687
I'm going to make this happen.

182
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,656
What's this?

183
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,657
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

184
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,493
That's where
Sae-byeok's little brother is.

185
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,287
If you can't get in touch with me,

186
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,916
please contact this number.

187
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,003
All right, I will.

188
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,025
Oh, for God's sake. You again?

189
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,740
Why do you keep bothering me like this?
I told you to find another broker.

190
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:17,036
Everyone else says she's dead.

191
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,580
Then she must be dead.

192
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,708
Do you think I can magically
bring people back to life?

193
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,461
You said she might be alive.

194
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
No, what I meant was

195
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,967
no one has actually witnessed her death
or found her body.

196
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,720
I wasn't saying that she's alive.

197
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,847
No one has seen her alive either.

198
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,187
Please look for her one last time.

199
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,856
Why is everyone offering me money?

200
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,651
I knew being kind has its rewards.

201
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,904
Please give it another try.

202
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,198
If this isn't enough,
I'll bring you more money.

203
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,038
If this was about money,
I would've asked for it a long time ago.

204
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,709
No-eul, you know
how hard I've tried to find her.

205
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,379
I felt bad for you
because I'm a father myself.

206
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,465
- I really did my best.
- I hear you.

207
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,760
Please, one last time.

208
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,472
Let me be honest with you.

209
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,058
How do you expect a one-year-old

210
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,144
to survive in North Korea
without her parents?

211
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,481
Besides, her mother shot her superior

212
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,192
and defected
to South Korea like a traitor...

213
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,368
I'm not saying it was your fault, No-eul.

214
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,038
That's just what happened.

215
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,838
I know it's harsh to tell a mother
to forget about her child,

216
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,133
but you really should.

217
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,177
There's nothing else you can do.

218
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm sorry. I'll move my car right away.

219
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,305
Ms. Kang No-eul.

220
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,509
Hi, Mother.

221
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,471
Where are you? Are you there yet?

222
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,973
I'm walking up there now.

223
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:30,062
Jun-ho. Take a look and see
if your brother has visited.

224
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:36,944
If he's alive, he would've left flowers
on the anniversary of his wife's death.

225
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,383
Did he come by?

226
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:00,842
No.

227
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,473
I suppose your brother

228
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,770
doesn't want us in his life anymore.

229
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,109
We haven't heard from him in years now.

230
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,945
It's probably because

231
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,615
he still resents me deep down.

232
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,454
We were also struggling back then,
and he knows that.

233
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,291
I just don't want him to think

234
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,837
that I favored you over him
because he's my stepson.

235
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,424
That's what I'm afraid of.

236
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,301
Please stop thinking that.

237
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,512
He knows that's not true.

238
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,682
Your brother...

239
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,603
He saved your life
by giving you one of his kidneys.

240
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,026
But when his wife got sick,

241
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,571
I couldn't do anything for her.

242
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,200
If I could have...

243
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,126
I would've sold my organs to help her.

244
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,920
If that were the issue,
he'd resent me instead.

245
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,133
If he hadn't given me his kidney,

246
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,219
he could've sold it
and gotten her the treatment she needed.

247
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,765
If I had just died--

248
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,058
Don't say such a thing.

249
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,809
Neither should you!

250
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,228
Stop saying these things!

251
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,775
Fate gave her that disease,

252
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,695
and it was In-ho's own decision
to take bribes.

253
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,200
You and I are not responsible
for what happened to him!

254
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,205
He simply paid for what he had done.

255
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm sorry.

256
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,292
RESIGNATION LETTER

257
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,794
It's for personal reasons.

258
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,880
Still, you can't quit so suddenly.

259
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,800
It'll be hard to find a replacement.

260
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,135
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,637
No-eul, how did you work in this thing?

262
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,599
Damn, it's even worse
than the stupid pig head.

263
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,311
Sir, this must be why No-eul is quitting.

264
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,897
Kids might be happy
seeing us in these things,

265
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,650
but it totally sucks
for the adults wearing them.

266
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,901
Isn't that right, No-eul?

267
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:09,573
We're having dinner together tonight.
You should come and say goodbye.

268
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,783
That's right.
You should join us for dinner.

269
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,454
And have a drink.
Everyone will be sad if you don't.

270
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,913
Thank you for everything.

271
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,174
Man, she's cold.
Right up until her last day.

272
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,094
I've worked with her for over two years,

273
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,513
but we've never even had
a real conversation.

274
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,726
I know. I don't know how she worked
this job with that kind of personality.

275
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,713
Here.

276
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,381
- What happened?
- I found her unconscious.

277
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,508
Na-yeon.

278
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,386
Na-yeon!

279
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,641
Are you with her?

280
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,767
Yes, I'm her father.

281
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,936
Please take her to
Seohyeon University Hospital.

282
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,956
All right. Open up for me.

283
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,612
SEOHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

284
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,999
PARK NA-YEON

285
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,418
There's a new medication
that's just come out.

286
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:14,924
It's for patients like Na-yeon
with recurrent cancer or a poor prognosis.

287
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,844
But it's not covered
by insurance at this point.

288
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,222
Doctor, I'll get the money somehow.

289
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,768
Please help Na-yeon.

290
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,356
Make an appointment for tomorrow.
I'll explain the details then.

291
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,774
To run tests...

292
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,888
These guys were in the Marine Corps.

293
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,142
These guys were in UDT.

294
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,437
And these guys were
in the ROK Special Forces.

295
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,314
Oh, and this guy is just a former cop.

296
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,191
As you can see,

297
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,861
they're tough men
who'd go through hell or high water

298
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,696
as long as the pay is right.

299
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,157
Right. This is the leader of the team.

300
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,160
He's a seasoned veteran
who has seen a lot of combat overseas.

301
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,911
Please call me Kim.

302
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,788
You must be careful tomorrow.

303
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,250
If they notice you,
it could ruin everything.

304
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,502
Don't worry.

305
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,046
Only you and I will go into the club.

306
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,549
These guys will be on standby nearby.

307
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,468
Will they even let you in?

308
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,179
Come on, I've already got
the perfect clubbing outfit.

309
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,222
I clean up well.

310
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,474
I'll go in with you.

311
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,683
No.

312
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,562
Your face was exposed on the island.
They might recognize you.

313
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,693
Don't make a move
until I give you the signal.

314
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,778
Understood.

315
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,159
And if something happens to me tomorrow--

316
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,411
Nothing is going to happen.

317
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,456
You've got your tracker.

318
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,710
Wherever you're taken,
we'll be right behind you.

319
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,670
So you can relax. Don't worry!

320
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,753
Dad?

321
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,258
Dad, is that you?

322
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,472
Ga-yeong, who's that?

323
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,308
I don't know. No one's saying anything.

324
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,853
It must be a prank call.

325
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,480
Hang up and come eat
before your soup gets cold.

326
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,816
All right.

327
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:21,588
If you wish to participate,
please state your name and birthdate.

328
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,798
June 25, 1994.

329
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,009
Kang No-eul.

330
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,179
Confirmed.

331
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,933
Here are the details
for your arranged pickup.

332
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,978
October 31, 2024,

333
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,482
at Tancheon parking lot
under Bongeun Bridge in Songpa-gu, Seoul.

334
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,465
Hey!

335
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,971
Wow, look at all these people.
What is going on today?

336
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,931
OCTOBER 31 MIDNIGHT
CLUB HDH

337
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,517
Wait, is it today?
Hall... What's it called again?

338
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,728
October 31, Halloween.

339
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,229
Yes, Halloween.

340
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:24,108
I'm getting a bad feeling.
This may be some kind of ruse.

341
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,944
That guy they call the Front Man.

342
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,365
You said he wears a gray hood
and a black mask, right?

343
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,574
Yes.

344
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,246
Oh, that must be why he chose today.
To cover his face.

345
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,375
That bastard is trying to be clever. Damn.

346
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,632
- Let's go.
- Okay.

347
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,098
Hold on!
Let me put something over my face.

348
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,184
I'll take this. How much?

349
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,538
We just got in! Can you hear me?
We're underground.

350
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,664
Yes, I can hear you.

351
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,124
And the tracker?

352
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
Working fine. What's your status?

353
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,462
It's totally crazy down here!

354
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:30,008
Everyone is wearing masks,
and I can't tell who's who!

355
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,011
Anyway, I'll let you know
if something happens.

356
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,053
All right.

357
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,925
The masked men are here.
They're going inside.

358
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,805
The masked men?
Hey, everyone here is wearing a mask!

359
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,641
The men in pink jumpsuits from the island!

360
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,436
Really?

361
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,658
What? Do I know you?

362
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
What the fuck?

363
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey, no cutting.
Go to the back of the line.

364
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,293
Police. Move.

365
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,547
See your fellow officers waiting in line?

366
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,593
It's Halloween.
Go put on your uniform first.

367
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,680
Does this look like a toy?

368
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,895
I don't see any pink jumpsuits!

369
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
What?

370
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,543
I just spotted one!
He's taking Mr. Seong somewhere!

371
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,877
I'll follow them!

372
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,296
- There were two of them.
- What? What did you say?

373
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,006
- There were two of them!
- What?

374
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,307
Mr. Choi, where are you?

375
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,768
Mr. Choi!

376
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,001
Mr. Choi!

377
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,134
They left the club. Get ready!

378
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,304
Guys, it's time to roll.

379
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,346
Get ready.

380
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,339
He just got into a white limo.
All teams, tail them.

381
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,883
We have to catch him. Keep that in mind.

382
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,842
Go.

383
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,979
Player 456.

384
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,607
Do you remember?

385
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,443
We once spoke in this car.

386
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,530
Was it this car?

387
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,285
It's nicer than I remember.

388
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,788
I sincerely hoped you'd have a good life.

389
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:33,125
I hoped you'd forget everything
that happened and be happy.

390
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,753
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

391
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,675
I'm almost moved to tears.

392
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,302
You should have gotten on that plane.

393
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,555
That's the best choice
you could have made.

394
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,724
I have never forgotten...

395
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,770
what you said to me then.

396
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,025
That's why I wanted
to see you again so badly.

397
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,862
Now that we're here,
say what you want to say.

398
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,156
What do you want from me?

399
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
Stop the game.

400
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,963
The game?

401
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,673
The game you've been playing.

402
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,302
The game
that's still going on to this day.

403
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,304
All we did was create it.

404
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,015
All of you participated by choice.

405
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,891
Don't give me that shit.

406
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,854
You manipulate people
who feel like they're at a dead end.

407
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
You drive them to their deaths
and enjoy it.

408
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,486
You think if you just call it
their own choice,

409
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,908
your filthy game will become
some sort of charity event?

410
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,412
They were all just losers of the game.

411
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,415
Trash eliminated from the competition.

412
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,170
A ton of new trash is being poured
into the world as we speak.

413
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,881
You still don't see, do you?

414
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,052
The game will not end
unless the world changes.

415
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,012
Do you have the limo in sight?

416
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,513
Yes, we see it.

417
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,850
It's on Seogang Bridge,
headed toward Yeouido. What now?

418
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,978
Don't do anything yet.
It has to be somewhere less crowded.

419
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:16,937
Understood.

420
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,447
"That's just how the world is,
so just shut up and accept it"?

421
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,077
That's a story created by people like you.

422
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,748
You think people are just
horses in a race,

423
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,709
and you own the horses.

424
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,255
Your way with words has improved.

425
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,386
So? Is your plan to convince
the owners of the horses?

426
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
To stop the race?

427
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,724
We're on it now.

428
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,893
But the limo's movements seem suspicious.

429
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,103
How so?

430
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,313
It's circling the Yeouido area.

431
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,525
They might have caught on already.
Stop the limo now!

432
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,985
Roger. Initiating the plan.

433
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,452
Shit!

434
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,788
What the hell?

435
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,039
What's going on?

436
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,416
One of the tires blew out.

437
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,709
Shit. Team Two will follow them.

438
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,337
- Okay. Back the car up now!
- Back up.

439
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
There's a sniper. Get down!

440
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,723
Both teams are under attack.
We have to abort the operation.

441
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,519
Or were you going to kidnap me?

442
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,896
I'll follow them.

443
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,240
They got me.

444
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,616
I'm losing them.

445
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,411
Stop the car.

446
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,170
Do you think you can stop the game
with a pistol?

447
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,899
Put me in the game.

448
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,984
You want to be in the game?

449
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,821
Put me back in the game.

450
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,617
Weren't you telling me
to stop the game just a second ago?

451
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,411
If I'm back in the game,

452
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,831
those fat cats you serve

453
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
will find it fun for sure.

454
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,046
So,

455
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,090
take me to the games.

456
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,597
What are you hesitating for?

457
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,475
Are you scared?

458
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,604
That you might lose to me
like Oh Il-nam did?

459
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,859
Oh Il-nam didn't want to admit it
until the moment he died.

460
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,863
He knew someone had come
to help that homeless man,

461
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,782
but he refused to look out the window.

462
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,450
But

463
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,831
when he stopped breathing,
I'm sure he knew

464
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,585
that he had lost.

465
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,172
Have you seen The Matrix?

466
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,717
They could've lived in peace
if they took the blue pill.

467
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:38,055
But they still chose the red pill
to play the heroes.

468
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,601
Do you also think you're a hero

469
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,603
who can change the world?

470
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,780
I'll show you

471
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,158
that the world...

472
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,997
doesn't always go

473
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
the way you want it to.

474
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,755
If that's what you want, have it your way.

475
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,510
Player 456.

476
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,097
Welcome back to the game.

477
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,520
We will now initiate plan B.

478
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:21,899
