1
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,360
Do you think Mr. Seong will be okay?

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,154
What if they already did something to him?

3
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,407
They wouldn't have brought him this far
if they wanted to kill him.

4
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,910
Do you think they've taken him
to the island where they play the games?

5
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,456
I'm not sure, but it seems likely.

6
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,126
If I recall,
the island was somewhere in this area.

7
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,047
"If we fail to capture the Front Man,
we infiltrate the island."

8
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,091
That was Mr. Seong's plan B.
It's going according to plan.

9
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,344
Once the games begin,
Mr. Seong's life may be in danger.

10
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,888
We must find him before it's too late.

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,100
If I catch those bastards,
I'm going to electrocute their asses.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,145
All right!

13
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,897
If everyone's aboard, let's go!

14
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,008
SQUID GAME 2

15
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,099
EPISODE 3
001

16
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,290
Player 456.

17
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,963
I sense you're holding on to many things.
You can't leave or stay.

18
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,759
You can't fight it. It's your destiny.

19
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,015
You have souls hovering over your head
who are lingering in this world.

20
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,686
You're not here of your own will.
Those vengeful souls brought you.

21
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,899
If we get out of here,
let me perform a ritual.

22
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,944
I can get rid of all your bad karma.

23
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,133
I would like to extend
a hearty welcome to all of you.

24
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:42,263
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

25
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:47,143
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

26
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,145
Excuse me.

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,363
You said I'd be playing games,
but you practically kidnapped me.

28
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,948
So how can I believe that?

29
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,494
I apologize.
Please understand that it was necessary

30
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,330
to maintain the game's security.

31
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,749
What's with the mask then?

32
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
Is your face also a secret?

33
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,714
Yeah! Why are you hiding your face?

34
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,968
Is this some kind of
illegal gambling house?

35
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,971
Even the dealers don't cover their faces
in those places.

36
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,018
To ensure fair gameplay
and confidentiality,

37
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:33,564
it is our policy not to reveal
the faces and identities of staff.

38
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,024
Please understand.

39
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,485
Did you take off my clothes
and put these on me?

40
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,903
What's with these shoes?

41
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,573
My shoes are limited fucking edition.

42
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,701
They're hard to find!

43
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,620
You going to replace them
if they get ruined?

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,207
These don't fit and the color sucks.

45
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,378
Can I just have
what you're wearing instead?

46
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,672
I like pink.

47
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,010
I'm sorry, but that is not possible.

48
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,513
You must be in your uniforms
for the games.

49
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,806
What about my phone?

50
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,811
Why did you take my phone and wallet?
Give them back, please.

51
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,023
We're keeping your belongings safe.

52
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,608
We'll return them once the games are over.

53
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,404
At least give me my phone.
I need to check the crypto market.

54
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,781
If I lose money, will you compensate me?

55
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,617
We will return it to you
once the games are over.

56
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,162
I need to monitor the real-time prices!

57
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,998
Do you know how much I've invested?

58
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,876
Player 333, Lee Myung-gi.

59
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,091
Age 30, used to run a YouTube channel
called MG Coin.

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,678
After convincing subscribers to invest
in a new crypto coin called Dalmatian,

61
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,181
causing losses
of approximately 15.2 billion won,

62
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,183
you shut down and disappeared.

63
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,643
You're wanted for fraud

64
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,229
and for violating telecom
and financial investment laws.

65
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,732
Current debt levels, 1.8 billion won.

66
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,818
Player 196, Kang Mi-na,
45 million won in debt.

67
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,905
Player 120, Cho Hyun-ju,
330 million won in debt.

68
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,076
Player 230, Choi Su-bong,
1.19 billion won in debt.

69
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,828
Player 198, Jang do-yeong,
1.4 billion won in debt.

70
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,331
Player 226, Kim Yeong-sam,
1.9 billion won in debt.

71
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,459
Player 444, Kim Nam-du,
2.02 billion won in debt.

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,295
Player 343, Sim Jae-seok,
2.89 billion won in debt.

73
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,339
Player 006, Park Mi-hwa,
3.1 billion won in debt.

74
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,050
Player 283, Lee Eun-ju,
4.02 billion won in debt.

75
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,802
Player 100, Im Jeong-dae,

76
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,804
ten billion won in debt.

77
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,098
One more game!

78
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,517
Ten billion? Who's that?

79
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,518
Who is it?

80
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,436
What are you looking at?

81
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,481
Do you think it's easy
to get a ten-billion-won loan?

82
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,109
They don't lend
that kind of money to just anyone!

83
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,736
Only to those
who are capable of paying it back.

84
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,242
All of you in this room

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,536
have crippling debts

86
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,580
and are now on a cliff-edge.

87
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,210
When we first came to you,
you did not trust us either.

88
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,629
But as you know, we played a game

89
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,882
and gave you money as promised.

90
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,843
And so you trusted us

91
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:12,056
and volunteered to participate
according to your own free will.

92
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,768
You have one last chance to decide.

93
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,273
Do you want to live like a piece of trash,
running from creditors?

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,610
Or will you seize
the last opportunity we are offering?

95
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,325
Getting closer.

96
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,746
I think it's one of those islands ahead.

97
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,462
Captain, let's pick up the speed.

98
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,213
Sure, as you wish.

99
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,226
What you see now

100
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,439
is the piggy bank where
your valuable prize money will be stored.

101
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,901
After each of the six games you will play,

102
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,988
the prize money will accumulate
in this piggy bank.

103
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,536
How much is the prize money?

104
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,499
The prize money for the games
is 45.6 billion won in total.

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,626
45.6 billion won?

106
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,794
And one of us will get it?

107
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,880
We will give you the details

108
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,966
about the distribution of the prize money
after the first game.

109
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:33,888
For these games,
you will be given a special new advantage.

110
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,014
What is it?

111
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,476
After each game,
you will be given a chance

112
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:42,480
to vote on whether
to continue the games or not.

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,191
If the majority votes to stop the games,

114
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:50,321
you can leave with the prize money
accumulated up to that point.

115
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,782
Are you saying

116
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,663
we'll still receive the money,
even if we leave after the first game?

117
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,958
That is correct.

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,349
Good heavens. Excuse me.

119
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,018
You idiot!

120
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,272
Mom! What... What are you doing here?

121
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,733
That's what I wanted to ask you!
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
You're embarrassing me.

123
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,027
Embarrassing?

124
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,738
If you knew what was embarrassing,
you wouldn't be here!

125
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,241
Stop it! We'll talk about this later.

126
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,744
No, we won't. Come on, you're leaving.

127
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,621
You're leaving now, okay?

128
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,081
Mom, why did you come here?

129
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,042
Do you realize where you are?
This is no place for an old lady!

130
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,169
Why did I come here?

131
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,132
To pay off your debt, of course!
Do you even have to ask?

132
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,217
You fool.

133
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,178
Why would you bring
a naive old woman here?

134
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,765
Will you take responsibility
if my mom collapses?

135
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,977
Yong-sik, I'll stay and do this.

136
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,062
You go home.

137
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,190
Stop it! I'm already here.
I can't just leave.

138
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,443
But you promised me.

139
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,279
You promised never to gamble again!

140
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,408
No, this isn't gambling.
We're just playing games here.

141
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,036
I'll just play one game and go.

142
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,996
You idiot, it's the same thing.

143
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,498
- Be quiet! That's enough!
- Don't you dare.

144
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:29,086
- Are you kidding me?
- They're just games! Right, everyone?

145
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:34,342
If you wish to participate in the games,
please sign the player consent form.

146
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,888
Those who do not wish to participate,
please speak up now.

147
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:43,309
We always give you a chance
to leave the games.

148
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,228
You'll really pay us
even if we play just one game?

149
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,027
Mom, you can't play any games.
Just go home!

150
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,029
If you're not leaving, neither am I.

151
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,240
- I'm not going anywhere without you.
- Will you hurry up?

152
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,714
The amazing Myung-gi from MG Coin?
Is that you?

153
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,259
Who are you?

154
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,180
You may not know me, but I know you.
MG Coin.

155
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,641
I was subscribed to your channel.

156
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,143
And I lost a shitload of money, asshole.

157
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,520
So did I.

158
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,689
You've got the wrong person.

159
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,234
I watched your content all day, every day.

160
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,028
Now I even see you in my dreams, motherfucker.

161
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,491
- Was your name Nam-su?
- It's Nam-gyu.

162
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,867
- From Club Pentagon.
- Right.

163
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,122
Thanks to you,
I bonded quickly with Nam-gyu here.

164
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,958
Because we shared the same pain.

165
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,963
I thought the sons of bitches
who made that coin

166
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,090
fled to the Philippines with the money.

167
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,344
So why are you here?
Did they cut you loose?

168
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,346
What do you want from me?

169
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,891
What do you think? Give me my money.

170
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,978
Did I force you to buy that coin?

171
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,564
You told us to bet it all, you fucker.

172
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,733
You swore it'd shoot up.

173
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,653
You said we'd be fucking idiots
if we didn't buy it!

174
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,576
"You are responsible for
the final decision on your investment."

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,829
Didn't you hear me say that at the end?

176
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,998
You said you watched every day.

177
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,752
- Hey, calm down!
- You asshole.

178
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,087
- All right now!
- Get off me.

179
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,422
Let go of me.

180
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,133
People are watching.

181
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,843
You don't want to be on the news.

182
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:51,562
You'd better do well
because I'm coming to get my money back.

183
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,981
Come on.

184
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,712
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

185
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,631
1. A PLAYER IS NOT ALLOWED
TO VOLUNTARILY QUIT THE GAMES

186
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
2. A PLAYER WHO REFUSES TO PLAY
WILL BE ELIMINATED

187
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,468
3. THE GAMES MAY BE TERMINATED
UPON A MAJORITY VOTE

188
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,261
IN CASE OF A TIE,
PLAYERS WILL VOTE AGAIN

189
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,514
4. IF THE GAMES ARE TERMINATED,
PLAYERS WILL DIVIDE THE PRIZE EQUALLY

190
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,598
SIGNATURE

191
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,810
Those who do not wish to participate,

192
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,604
please speak up now.

193
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,953
SEONG GI-HUN

194
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:53,374
A man shouldn't go back on his word.
You said you were giving up.

195
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,751
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,462
It was urgent,
and you were the only person I could call.

197
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,551
You showed up out of the blue
with those men in black.

198
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,344
What the hell is going on?

199
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,430
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the captain of this boat.

200
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,433
Tell me what the situation is.

201
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,853
I got a lead on where the island is.

202
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,814
And what is it?

203
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,983
I found someone who played the games.

204
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,653
- Really?
- Yes.

205
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,072
But it looks like
he's been taken back there.

206
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,325
We're tracking his location.

207
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,411
Detective Hwang!

208
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,039
My device is telling me
it's that island over there!

209
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,499
Are you familiar with it?

210
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,586
Yeah, people used to live there.

211
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,172
Nowadays, people just go there to fish
from time to time.

212
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,677
It seems like it may be the right place.

213
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,096
If it is, there should be
roads for vehicles

214
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,348
and facilities like a helicopter pad.

215
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,725
I'll fly the drone over and see.

216
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,352
You should go ashore
and follow the tracker.

217
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,314
Okay. Listen up! Get ready to disembark!

218
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,443
The first game will begin momentarily.

219
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,444
Smile.

220
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,530
After having your picture taken,

221
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,327
follow the staff's instructions
and proceed to the game site.

222
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,870
You're Thanos, the rapper.

223
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,830
Oh, shit.

224
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
Please look into the camera.

225
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,543
I'm gonna kill half of humanity
With my raps, bam

226
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,796
The runner-up
of The Rap Battleground final.

227
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,551
I'm Gyeong-su, big fan.
I've been to several of your concerts.

228
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,219
Please take a picture with me.

229
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,263
- Me too!
- Me too!

230
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,223
Hang on, guys!

231
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,477
Let's make this easier on Thanos
and take one picture together.

232
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,645
Would that be okay?

233
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,566
- All right, let's get together.
- It's Thanos!

234
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,195
Hey, I don't mind
having one more person. Come on.

235
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,154
Smile.

236
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,742
Are we all in the shot?

237
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,494
You are not allowed to do this.

238
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,122
You want to be in the picture? Come on.

239
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,583
You must take your photos one by one.

240
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,752
Come on, can't you make an exception?

241
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,421
You took our phones,
and we can't take any pictures.

242
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,923
No.

243
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,972
When we get out of here,
I'll take a picture with each of you.

244
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,016
- Okay. Guys, let's go.
- All right! Sweet!

245
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,147
Please look into the camera.

246
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,816
Smile.

247
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,081
Is that a man or a woman?

248
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,666
There are people like that.

249
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,253
They're men who want to be women.

250
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,506
Why would they want to be women?

251
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,383
Men are men, and women are women.

252
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,010
You can't say things like that.

253
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,845
Good grief, that's unsightly.

254
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,767
Please look into the camera.

255
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,685
Smile.

256
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,875
What?

257
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,881
Gi-hun!

258
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,467
Jung-bae.

259
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,094
Fuck, you were alive this whole time?

260
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,804
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,640
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

262
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,727
No one's heard from you for three years.
I heard your mom passed away.

263
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,687
I had to hear about it from my wife!

264
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,606
What kind of friend are you?

265
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,068
Were you going to cut me out
because I didn't lend you money?

266
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,778
Keep moving! Don't block the way.

267
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,114
It's not like that.

268
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,909
It's a long story.

269
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,788
Right. I can imagine,
seeing as you're here.

270
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,249
Still, you should've told me
about your mom.

271
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,543
You know how much she liked me.

272
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,753
Why are you here?

273
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,005
What about your wife?

274
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,007
We got divorced.

275
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,675
Divorced?

276
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,178
What about your kid?

277
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,638
With my wife.

278
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,058
Why? I thought you guys were doing okay.

279
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,145
Did you have an affair?

280
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,147
Yeah, like I could manage one.

281
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,565
Let's not talk about it here.

282
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,776
When we get out,
let's go for a drink and talk.

283
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,908
Jung-bae. Whatever happens from now on,
stay close to me.

284
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,410
"Stay close"? You've gotten melodramatic.

285
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,995
Just do as I say!

286
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,998
You must stay close behind me!

287
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,628
All right, man. I will.

288
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,381
Like this? Like Follow the Leader?

289
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,717
By the way, this is crazy.
What is this place?

290
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,744
This way!

291
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,670
Start from the coast. Keep it low.

292
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,754
Got it.

293
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,025
Damn.

294
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,528
- Welcome to the first game.
- My legs! That was a lot of stairs.

295
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:02,242
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

296
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,119
Let me repeat.

297
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,579
All players,

298
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,208
- please wait a moment on the field.
- Hey, señorita.

299
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,877
Don't you know who I am?

300
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,961
Do I have to?

301
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,755
No, you don't.

302
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,883
We can get to know each other.
Tell me about yourself.

303
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,927
Are you hitting on me?

304
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,306
In the sea of faces, you caught my eye

305
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,476
My beauty, my flower blooming among weeds

306
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,521
Red, orange, yellow, green
I'm a legend, Thanos

307
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,858
Look at us in this blue-green

308
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,110
Now give me the green light

309
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,948
I like you!

310
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,331
What's that?

311
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,709
What's that thing?

312
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,229
Damn, this isn't built for us to walk on.

313
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,609
I found him! Over there!

314
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,347
The first game is Red Light, Green Light.

315
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,517
- We're playing Red Light, Green Light?
- See?

316
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,936
We're playing games, not gambling.

317
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,438
This is a children's game.

318
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,776
Red Light, Green Light? The kids' game?

319
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,111
Hey, you.

320
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,529
Me?

321
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,199
What... What are you doing?

322
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,661
- Damn it.
- Hey, what are you doing?

323
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,705
- Freeze. Don't move.
- Who the hell are you?

324
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,457
Do not move.

325
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,208
What are you doing?

326
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,964
Is that your dental implant?

327
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,549
Where is it?

328
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,060
Damn it.

329
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,238
I'm fucked.

330
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,574
- Where did you get this?
- Get what?

331
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,159
Why was this in here?

332
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,245
That? Before I got on the boat here,

333
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:56,333
some guy said he had leftover bait
and gave that to me. Why?

334
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,420
Detective Hwang, we're screwed.
They're onto us.

335
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,215
They put the GPS tracker on someone else.

336
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,470
We are ready to start the game.

337
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,561
Start.

338
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:22,651
Cross the finish line in five minutes
without getting caught.

339
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,362
- If you do, you pass.
- Everyone!

340
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,741
Everyone, listen up! Pay attention!

341
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,663
Listen carefully!

342
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,499
This is not just a game!

343
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,751
If you lose the game,

344
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,628
you die!

345
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,467
What is he saying?

346
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,763
Hey! What are you talking about?

347
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,434
We're going to die
playing Red Light, Green Light?

348
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,519
- Red light...
- Yes, that's right!

349
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,731
If they catch you moving,
they will kill you!

350
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,442
They will shoot you from somewhere!

351
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,068
That guy must be drunk.

352
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,487
- Stay on your toes!
- He says they'll shoot us if we lose.

353
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,114
He sounds like my old man

354
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,034
when he gets home drunk
and starts talking crazy.

355
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,912
- Says there's a freaking bug in his head.
- If you get caught, you die!

356
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:20,584
That doll's eyes are motion detectors!

357
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,878
- See? Talking about devices.
- Stay on your toes!

358
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,172
We might get to join Dad today.

359
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,008
What the hell are you talking about?

360
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,637
I think he's trying to scare us
so he can win the prize money.

361
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,930
That's right!

362
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,515
Don't pull any tricks, asshole!

363
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,976
You have to believe me!

364
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:11,092
Do not be alarmed or panic!

365
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,722
No matter what happens,
do not panic and start running!

366
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,849
Let the game begin.

367
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:27,192
Green light, red light.

368
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,654
Freeze!

369
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,292
Well done!
You just need to stay calm like this!

370
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,963
We just have to move
and stop at the right time.

371
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,839
- What's with him?
- Then we can all win.

372
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,967
- We can survive together!
- Do you know him?

373
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,969
No, I don't.

374
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:00,517
Green light, red light.

375
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,893
Freeze!

376
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,855
Don't move and stay still!

377
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,357
Just relax!

378
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,026
Cut it out. It's you that's scaring me!

379
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,696
Speak with your mouth covered.
It's dangerous.

380
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,701
Green light, red light.

381
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,203
- Why aren't you moving?
- Freeze!

382
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:32,507
Green light, red light.

383
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,925
Freeze!

384
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,052
- Are you crazy?
- I said cover your mouth!

385
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:43,393
- Green light, red light.
- Follow me!

386
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,769
Freeze!

387
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,448
Green light, red light.

388
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,699
Freeze!

389
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,708
Green light, red light.

390
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,835
Freeze!

391
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,046
Nobody move!

392
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,964
Is he high or what?

393
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,258
Nope.
No one is like that when they're high.

394
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,676
You've been high?

395
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,595
You interested?

396
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,809
What's that?

397
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,065
He knows you're a flower.
There's a bee on you.

398
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,358
A bee?

399
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,987
Crap.

400
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,405
I just moved.

401
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,456
Nobody move!

402
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,584
You must not move!

403
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,878
Player 196, eliminated.

404
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:58,176
Jung-bae.
No matter what happens, don't move.

405
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,307
Do not move!

406
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,570
No! Don't move!

407
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,281
Stay still!

408
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,330
If you run, you'll die!

409
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,836
You will all die if you move!

410
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,887
Don't move! Keep yourselves still!

411
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,764
Don't move, please!

412
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,237
Don't move, please!

413
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,909
Freeze!

414
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,549
Let me repeat.

415
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:25,805
You can move forward while the tagger
shouts, "Green light, red light."

416
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,683
If your movement is detected afterward,

417
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,227
you will be eliminated.

418
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:59,964
Green light, red light.

419
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,948
Green light, red light.

420
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:41,089
Green light, red light.

421
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,554
You'll also die
if you don't make it there in time!

422
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,808
That doll is a motion detector!

423
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,352
But it can't detect motion
that's not visible to it!

424
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,482
Get behind someone bigger than you!

425
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,985
Like you're doing Follow the Leader!

426
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,322
We're running out of time!
We've got to move!

427
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:13,121
- Get behind me.
- Green light, red light.

428
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,251
Gi-hun.

429
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,963
I'll stay close to you now.

430
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,465
Player 188.

431
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,349
Player 244.

432
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,918
Green light, red light.

433
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,974
Green light, red light.

434
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,538
Do not move.

435
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,581
Are you okay?

436
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,042
Get close to me.

437
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,961
Do not move!

438
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,337
Freeze!

439
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,756
What the hell?

440
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,305
Bye.

441
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,470
Let's go!

442
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:22,018
Green light, red light...

443
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,191
It wasn't me.

444
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,361
- She pushed me. I didn't move!
- Player 444.

445
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,779
It was her.

446
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,283
I didn't move.

447
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,996
Player 444, eliminated.

448
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,125
You can do this!

449
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,836
You're almost there!

450
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,381
Green light, red light.

451
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,342
Please help me.

452
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,855
- Green light, red light.
-   Hey! Where are you going?

453
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,443
Please help me.

454
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,989
I'll help you. Get up on this turn.

455
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,911
Green light, red light.

456
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,723
Green...

457
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:29,187
light...

458
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:35,735
red light.

459
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,117
Are you okay?

460
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,328
Thank you.

461
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,622
Thank you.

462
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,850
Number 011.

463
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,603
Was that you?

464
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,357
I simply took out a loser.

465
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,279
Player 444, eliminated.

466
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:02,738
Soldiers who have completed your mission,
please line up outside the sniper rooms.

467
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,646
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

468
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,357
We should at least search
some nearby islands.

469
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,819
They led us here, so I don't think
they're anywhere in this area.

470
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,238
A storm warning
has been issued for tonight.

471
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,365
We'd better head back to port.

472
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,575
Damn it.

473
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,702
The search may take a while.

474
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,204
We should go back
and come up with a new plan.

475
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,999
Who leaked the information?

476
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,836
Did one of you get drunk
and blab about it somewhere?

477
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,387
All right, it's getting cold and dark.
Let's get moving.

478
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,580
You're not feeling well?

479
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,793
- Don't worry.
- What?

480
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,211
I'm okay.

481
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,673
Gi-hun. What the hell is that creepy doll?

482
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,217
It shoots people with its eyes.

483
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,845
It's not the doll.

484
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,307
There are shooters.

485
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,353
How do you know so much?

486
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,814
Have you really been here before?

487
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:24,547
Congratulations for making it
through the first game.

488
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,926
Here are the results of the first game.

489
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,517
Out of 456 players,
91 players have been eliminated.

490
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,063
365 players have completed the first game.

491
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:48,571
Congratulations again
for making it through the first game.

492
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,240
Sir! Please don't kill us!

493
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,118
Please don't kill us. I beg you!

494
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,163
As for my son's debt,

495
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:02,042
I will do whatever it takes
to pay you back!

496
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,753
Please forgive us!

497
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,423
Don't just stand there.
Beg for his forgiveness.

498
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,802
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

499
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,764
- I promise I'll pay it back!
- There seems to be a misunderstanding.

500
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,808
Please don't kill us!

501
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,313
- Please don't kill us!
- Please spare us!

502
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,027
We are not trying to harm you.

503
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,613
We are presenting you with an opportunity.

504
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,448
Clause three of the consent form.

505
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,622
"The games may be terminated
upon a majority vote."

506
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,332
Correct?

507
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,959
That is correct.

508
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,670
Then let us take a vote right now.

509
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,007
Of course.

510
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,596
We respect your right
to freedom of choice.

511
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,897
But first, let me announce
the prize amount that's been accumulated.

512
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,901
The number of players
eliminated in the first game is 91.

513
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,780
Therefore, a total of 9.1 billion won
has been accumulated.

514
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,909
If you quit the games now, the 365 of you

515
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,997
can equally divide the 9.1 billion won

516
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,207
and leave with your share.

517
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,918
How much is that?

518
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:12,631
Each person's share would be
24,931,500 won.

519
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,384
Fuck. We almost died,
and they're giving us 24 million?

520
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,344
That's fucking bullshit.

521
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,638
Twenty million?

522
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,642
You said 45.6 billion!

523
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,853
The rule is that

524
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,607
a hundred million won will be accumulated
for each eliminated player.

525
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,902
If you choose to play the next game
and more players get eliminated,

526
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,031
the prize amount
will increase accordingly.

527
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,076
How much will it be
if you survive until the end?

528
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,037
As I already told you,

529
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,957
the total amount of prize money
for all 456 players

530
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,959
is 45.6 billion won.

531
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,546
Those who make it through all six games

532
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:56,342
will equally divide the 45.6 billion won.

533
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:01,430
So if you're the only one to survive,
you get 45.6 billion?

534
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,766
That is correct.

535
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,560
45.6 billion? Wow!

536
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:12,107
So we can take a vote again
and decide to leave after the next game?

537
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,401
As promised in the consent form,

538
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,696
you can take a vote after each game

539
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,867
and decide to leave with the prize money
accumulated up to that point.

540
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:29,958
We always prioritize
your voluntary participation.

541
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,590
Now, let's begin the vote.

542
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,345
If you wish to continue the games,
press the O button.

543
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,516
If you wish to end them,
press the X button.

544
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,980
The vote will be held
in reverse order of your player numbers.

545
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,651
Player 456.

546
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,586
It's all pointless!

547
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,549
You didn't decide
when to come into this world,

548
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,094
and you can't decide
when you leave it either.

549
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,639
When and where you die

550
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,934
were already decided by the gods
the moment you were born.

551
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,399
No matter how hard you try,
you can never escape it.

552
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,740
Once you finish voting,

553
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,617
put the patch you are given
on the right side of your chest

554
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,954
and stand on the side you have chosen.

555
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,542
Player 454.

556
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,432
Player 453.

557
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,931
Player 390.

558
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,479
Player 388.

559
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,279
Player 380.

560
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,700
Player 333.

561
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,257
Player 332.

562
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
Player 246.

563
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,027
Player 230.

564
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,581
Wait a minute, everyone! Wait!

565
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,876
You can't do this.

566
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,003
Come to your senses!

567
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,546
Don't you see?

568
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,048
These aren't just any games.

569
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,634
We will all die if we keep playing!

570
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,263
We have to get out of here now.

571
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,390
With a majority vote, we can!

572
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,475
We must stop here!

573
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,477
Who do you think you are?

574
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,647
Why do you keep
egging people on like that?

575
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,650
You scared us by saying they'd shoot us
before the game even began!

576
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,068
That's right!

577
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,572
He was going on about how we'd die,

578
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,074
and I almost did because I got so nervous!

579
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,535
How did you know
they were going to shoot us?

580
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,745
Are you one of them?

581
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,125
Are you conning us all
by pretending to be a player?

582
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,294
Who is this guy?

583
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,130
Did you plant him to mess with our heads?

584
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,758
That's uncalled for.

585
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,512
We wouldn't have won the game
and survived if it weren't for him!

586
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:57,059
And you! I saw how scared you were.
Your legs were shaking.

587
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,519
You should thank him,
not treat him like a fraud!

588
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,230
And who the hell are you?
Are you conspiring with him?

589
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,815
Rude. How old are you?

590
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,901
Older than you. What are you going to do?

591
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,985
- Come on now.
- What?

592
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,988
Please don't do this. Listen.

593
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:13,742
None of us would be alive

594
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:18,246
if it weren't for this gentleman.

595
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,041
So enough with the greed.

596
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,460
Let's put our lives first

597
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,504
and get out of this place! Okay?

598
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,507
- That's right!
- Let's all get out of here!

599
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,343
- Let's get out of here!
- No, we have to keep playing!

600
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:40,018
I have played these games before!

601
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,856
I have done this before!

602
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:51,697
I knew about the first game
because I had played it before!

603
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,742
I played the games here three years ago!

604
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,912
And everyone who was with me...

605
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,125
died here!

606
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,670
- They all died?
- All of them?

607
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,422
- Really? No way.
- Hold on.

608
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,049
If they all died,
how did you survive alone?

609
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,388
Wait, are you saying
you were the sole winner?

610
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,976
That's right.

611
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,897
I was the final winner.

612
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,195
If we continue the games,

613
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,033
every single person here,

614
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,911
just like all the people back then,

615
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,706
will die in the end.

616
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,502
Bullshit.

617
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:52,507
If you were the sole winner,
it means you won 45.6 billion won.

618
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,677
If you really did,
why would you come back here?

619
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,554
That's right! He's lying!

620
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,764
Cut the crap!

621
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,931
He's a total nutcase!

622
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,892
If someone like you can win, so can I!

623
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,853
If you really won,
it actually works better for us.

624
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,065
You can give us some tips

625
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,526
on how to beat these games.

626
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,445
That's right!

627
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:18,283
We have a previous winner with us,
so what do we have to worry about?

628
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,911
Come on, let's do this!

629
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,162
- Come on!
- Yeah!

630
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,498
- Let's make some money!
- Let's do this!

631
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,503
- Let's do it!
- Let's try!

632
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,214
Let's make money!

633
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,259
Please, I'm begging you.
We have to get out now!

634
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,055
If we keep playing, more people will die.

635
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,266
That could be you.

636
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,270
We have to stop this now
and get out of here.

637
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,606
Everyone.

638
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:56,988
From here on, we will not tolerate actions
that disrupt the voting process.

639
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,285
Now, let's resume the vote.

640
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,745
