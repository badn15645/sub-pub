SQUID GAME 2

2
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,150
EPISODE 4
SIX LEGS

3
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
Just like my mom used to make.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,885
What's in yours?

5
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,972
Aren't you going to eat?

6
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,976
Look, you've got to eat.

7
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,896
You know what they say.
"Eat up, even on your deathbed."

8
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,358
Just do your thinking while you eat,
or afterwards. Here.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,152
Come on.

10
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
Forget it then.

11
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,408
This might be for the best.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,579
I don't know about you,

13
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,958
but that 20 million
wouldn't even cover my interest.

14
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,793
If we play just one more game--

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,794
Jung-bae.

16
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,342
Last time I was here,
someone said the exact same thing.

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,762
And in the end,

18
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,182
that person died here.

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,019
Help us then, sir.

20
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,857
You said you've played these games.

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,154
I pressed the O button because of you.

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,034
Honestly, I was scared.
I wanted to quit and leave.

23
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,248
But you made me think
maybe I could play just one more game.

24
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,875
- Me too.
- Same here.

25
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,501
- Yes.
- Me too.

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,840
Sir.

27
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,468
You know which game's next, don't you?

28
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,432
That's right.

29
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
You're a previous winner,
so you should know.

30
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
What are we playing next?

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,442
The second game

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,445
was Dalgona.

33
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,534
Dalgona? The sugar candy
with a shape you can carve out?

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,203
That's right.

35
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,123
We had to choose one of four shapes
and carve it out.

36
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,793
Four shapes? Which was the easiest one?

37
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,086
Triangle.

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
Which was the hardest one?

39
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,716
Umbrella.

40
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,717
Umbrella?

41
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,763
Some people chose umbrella?

42
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,062
Those unlucky bastards
must have bitten the dust.

43
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,988
So that means
we should all just pick triangle.

44
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,532
Everyone could probably pass the round.

45
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,159
Hush now!

46
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,539
If all 365 of us survive,
the prize money won't go up at all.

47
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,251
Then we'll have risked
our lives again for nothing.

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,294
- That's true.
- He's right.

49
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:18,174
Listen. We should probably
keep this information to ourselves.

50
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,301
- What do you say?
- Let's do that.

51
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,970
We can't do that.

52
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,847
I'm telling you this
to save everyone's lives.

53
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,268
If it's confirmed
that the next game is Dalgona,

54
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,728
I'm going to tell everyone what I know.

55
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,111
Dalgona, triangle.

56
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,995
So which shape did you pick?

57
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,211
Mom. I just found out something important.

58
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
Shit. Mom!

59
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,934
Have this too.

60
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,647
You should eat it for your baby.

61
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,483
Eggs are good for pregnant women.

62
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,867
I've helped more than
a dozen women in my neighborhood

63
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
deliver their babies.

64
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:34,125
I can tell just by looking at
your body shape and the way you walk.

65
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,004
It looks like
your due date is getting close.

66
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
If you compress your belly to hide it,

67
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,385
it'll be bad for both you and your baby.
It could be dangerous.

68
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,721
That's why you were in pain earlier.

69
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,348
It's not what you think.

70
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,645
How did you end up in a place like this
in your condition?

71
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,148
- What are you doing here?
- You startled me!

72
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,025
- Come. No time for socializing.
- What...

73
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,277
All right, just wait.

74
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,237
You should finish your food,

75
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,656
and if something feels off,
come find me right away.

76
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,785
- Come on!
- I'll be over there, okay?

77
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,953
Why? What is it?

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,925
May I ask you something?

79
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,643
Why did you come back to this place?

80
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,397
You said you won and made it out.

81
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,149
Then you must have received 45.6 billion.

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,693
Did you spend it all?

83
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,405
Did you bet on horses again?

84
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
That money doesn't belong to me.

85
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,121
It's blood money
for the people who died here.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,208
The same goes for the money up there.

87
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
You don't have to think of it that way.

88
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,007
It's not like you killed those people,

89
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,927
and saving that money
won't bring them back to life.

90
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,599
If you had pressed the X,
everyone here would've made it out alive.

91
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,521
That's right.
I was the last to press the O button.

92
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,861
But there were 182 more people
who wanted to stay.

93
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,823
And there were also 182 people
who wanted to leave.

94
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,950
Let's say

95
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:37,206
I pressed X and we all left.
Would everyone have been happy?

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,042
Do you think if they ran into me later,

97
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:45,423
they'd thank me for saving their lives
and tell me they're happy now?

98
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,639
All right.
There's no point in placing blame now.

99
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,684
You know the saying,
a widow understands a widower best.

100
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,479
Let's just focus on tomorrow's game, okay?

101
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,564
He has won all these games before.

102
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,901
If we stick together,
we'll have nothing to worry about.

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,152
He's right, sirs.

104
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,783
We have to stick together.

105
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,702
I'll be with you all the way.

106
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,828
Who are you?

107
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,330
My good sir.

108
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,709
I'm Dae-ho. Kang Dae-ho.

109
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,128
- Oh, Mr. Dae-ho.
- Yes.

110
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,046
Have we met?

111
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,843
Earlier during the game,
Mr. 456 here was like,

112
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,847
"Freeze!" And I became his fan.

113
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,808
I'd like to get to know you, sirs.
Please give me the chance!

114
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
"Freeze!" That was so cool.

115
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,355
Hang on.

116
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,564
Yes, sir?

117
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,815
You were in the Marines?

118
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,108
Yes, why?

119
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,193
Class number?

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
You're laughing?

121
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,163
Victory at all costs!

122
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,998
I was in Class 1140, sir!

123
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,416
At ease!

124
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
"Dae-ho."

125
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,963
I knew there was something about you.

126
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,674
- Sir!
- Class 746 here. Let's make a good team.

127
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,716
I won't let you down!

128
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,469
Sir!

129
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,054
You're full of spirit.

130
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,014
Yes, sir!

131
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
Yes!

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,854
Enjoying your food?

133
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,274
I couldn't eat.

134
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:30,027
After seeing everyone get shot dead,
you still have a damn appetite?

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,322
That crypto ruined my life too.

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,409
That's why I'm here, to make money.

137
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
That's right.
You'd better make a lot of money.

138
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,498
Because of that damn coin,

139
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:47,837
I lost over 500 million won, the money
I earned from busting my ass rapping.

140
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,171
I lost 300 million.

141
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,801
You'd better win the games
and make a load of money to pay us back.

142
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,846
I get it. Can you go away now?
I'm trying to eat--

143
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,725
You little shit,
eating like a fucking pig.

144
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,310
Give it back.

145
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,227
No.

146
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,689
You want to eat this so badly?

147
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,483
Then Thanos will feed you.

148
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,780
Good, isn't it?

149
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,577
- You motherfucker.
- Son of a bitch.

150
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,746
- You asshole.
- Knock it off.

151
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,372
Fucking asshole.

152
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,084
Son of a bitch.

153
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,920
I lost all that money
because of you, fucker.

154
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,215
- You piece of shit.
- Let me get in there.

155
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,092
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey.

156
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,260
Step aside.

157
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,514
Be grateful and fucking eat
what you're given!

158
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:44,018
It's good to be young.
They still have the energy to do that.

159
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,563
He might get really hurt.
Someone should stop them.

160
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,648
I know.

161
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,400
Me?

162
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,325
Boys, what are you doing
in the middle of mealtime?

163
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,035
No fights during mealtime.

164
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,579
There are elders present.
Mind your manners.

165
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,456
And two against one?

166
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
Aren't you embarrassed?

167
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,796
You're lecturing me
when you ended up in this shithole too?

168
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,550
Dude, stop running your mouth

169
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,011
and take care of your own damn kids.

170
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,889
What did you just say?

171
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,851
I said save the lecture
for your own damn kid.

172
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,728
You son of a bitch.

173
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,196
Wait.

174
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,288
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,750
Please...

176
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,922
Let me go.

177
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,558
- Great! You're the man!
- Nice!

178
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,603
That was cool!

179
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,820
What is he?

180
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,239
Is he an ex-Marine too?

181
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,042
The day's work has been completed.

182
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,130
All soldiers,
please return to your quarters.

183
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,607
Na-yeon!

184
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,819
Are you with her?

185
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,237
Yes, I'm her father.

186
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,364
Please take her
to Seohyeon University Hospital.

187
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,928
Dissolve my karmic ties and grievances...

188
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,204
Mom, are you asleep?

189
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,594
Honey, I'm sorry.

190
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,392
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,771
Excuse me.

192
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,401
If you're still up,
can we have a little talk?

193
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,112
Sure.

194
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,415
I think I was out of line before.
I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry.

195
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,834
No, that's okay.

196
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,547
I laid all the blame on you.

197
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,092
I was out of line.

198
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,436
My wife is very sick.

199
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,442
She has acute cirrhosis.
She needs a liver transplant.

200
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,613
But when she was going through the tests,

201
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,116
we found out she was pregnant.

202
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,203
The doctor suggested a termination,

203
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,956
but she won't listen.

204
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,043
Says she'll give birth
even if it kills her.

205
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,172
You see, my wife is stubborn.

206
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,176
I've never been able
to change her mind about anything.

207
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,974
We were struggling to find a donor,
and her condition was getting worse.

208
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,728
I borrowed as much money as I could,

209
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,397
but it still wasn't enough.

210
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,278
I was desperate.
Then one of my oldest vendors

211
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
heard about my situation
and offered to help.

212
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,368
So I borrowed money from them.

213
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,665
But people saw it as a bribe,

214
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,877
and I got fired from my job.

215
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,131
I had devoted my entire youth to it.

216
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,138
These games were my last hope.

217
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,727
I get it.

218
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,399
I know what
you were trying to say, Mr. 456.

219
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
What that money represents.

220
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
But I...

221
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,914
I really need that money,

222
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,958
even if it's blood money.

223
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
I need that money...

224
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,852
to save my wife and our child.

225
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,874
Close up.

226
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,626
Why? Nothing usable?

227
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,888
What the hell?

228
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,933
This is it? Where's the rest?

229
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,019
The organs were not viable.

230
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,022
Dead too long.
Only the eyes were salvageable.

231
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,858
I told you to bring live ones.

232
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,694
What are you talking about?
I missed on purpose.

233
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,281
Someone shot them again
to make sure they died.

234
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,953
That guy too.

235
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,500
He was shot in the leg,
but someone shot him again in the head.

236
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,089
Who's doing this?

237
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,525
Identity confirmed.

238
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,155
Sir. Reporting from the operating room.

239
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,615
How did it go?

240
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,704
Most players were shot in the head
or chest and died on the spot.

241
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,749
Someone shot those who were still alive
a second time to confirm the kill.

242
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,751
We only got a few usable products.

243
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,589
Who did that?

244
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,426
Number 011, I think.

245
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,206
Number 011.

246
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,878
Officer wants to see you.

247
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,712
Identity confirmed.

248
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,417
You wanted to see me, sir?

249
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,212
Mask off.

250
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,890
I told you not to interfere
if you're not going to help.

251
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,732
I hear you shot them a second time
to make sure they died.

252
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,944
I was just doing my job.

253
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,991
How long...

254
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,369
have we known each other?

255
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,705
I don't quite remember.

256
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,872
If I remember correctly...

257
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,756
it's been about seven years.

258
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,721
When I first went to see you,

259
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:52,019
you were staring at the ceiling
like a corpse in that cheap hospital room.

260
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,273
I couldn't believe you had taken out
the entire pursuit unit

261
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,235
and made your way
to the demarcation line by yourself.

262
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,161
I felt bad for you.

263
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,417
I wanted to give you a second chance.

264
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,295
I've always been grateful to you.

265
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,672
Then do what I tell you.

266
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,549
I do not wish to.

267
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,304
Are you afraid the captain might find out?

268
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,475
You don't have to worry about that.

269
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,103
We made a mistake last time
and had a player do the operations

270
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,605
in exchange for game info.

271
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,733
This time, we hired a doctor from outside.

272
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,361
So he will never find out,
and even if he does--

273
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,362
It's not about that.

274
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,946
Then what is it about?

275
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,554
When we first met, you said you wanted
to find the child you left behind.

276
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,308
You said you'd do anything.

277
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,147
Did you have a change of heart?

278
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
When you first came to me,

279
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,531
you said my job here would be

280
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,495
helping those who feel hopeless
by putting them out of their misery.

281
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,459
I trusted you.
That's what I came here to do.

282
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,672
You're the one who has changed.

283
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,218
Those people are going to die anyway.

284
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,472
We're just using their organs
to save others.

285
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
What's wrong with that?

286
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,354
If there are no further orders,
I'd like to be excused.

287
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,124
SEOUL DOBONG POLICE STATION

288
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,635
Hey, Hwang. It's been a while.

289
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,100
Hwang Jun-ho!

290
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,312
You handed in your resignation
without a word to me?

291
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,856
Then you went MIA.
Where the hell have you been?

292
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,443
Do you know how much I had to beg
to change it to a leave of absence?

293
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,945
Chief, are you finished?

294
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,946
What?

295
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,156
Please help me.

296
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,368
Look, what else
could I possibly do for you?

297
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,454
You want me to look
for that island with you?

298
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,872
Yes.

299
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,082
For God's sake.

300
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,335
We must start the search immediately.

301
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,214
Otherwise, Mr. Seong Gi-hun
and everyone else there will be in danger.

302
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,759
Haven't we already finished
discussing this?

303
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,720
Sir, things have changed since then.

304
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,766
If we don't stop them now,
we may not get another chance.

305
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,725
Chief Kim.

306
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,643
Yes, sir.

307
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,896
What's gotten into him this time?
You said he was doing better.

308
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,359
Jun-ho, go back to therapy.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

309
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,485
Sir!

310
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,279
Are you really going to let
those people die?

311
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,574
You've been talking about
this shit for years now!

312
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,826
If it's true, bring me evidence!

313
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,622
The police work with evidence!

314
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,963
Process his resignation.

315
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,589
He's beyond help now.

316
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,132
But, sir...

317
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,220
Damn it. Hey!

318
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,391
I told you this was a bad idea.
You'll never be able to come back now.

319
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:04,145
Sir! I'll make sure
he goes back to therapy! Please wait!

320
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,566
See? What did I tell you?
Police are never helpful.

321
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,112
We'll do it ourselves. If we split into
two teams, we might have a chance.

322
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,324
Yeah.
Captain Park got another boat for us,

323
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,159
and we also got more men.

324
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,036
We divided them into two search teams.

325
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,204
Okay, good.

326
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,583
If the games have begun,
we only have five days at most.

327
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,834
We've got to move fast.

328
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,085
Got it.

329
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,046
We're all set to go
once the weather clears up.

330
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,506
I'll see you soon.

331
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,769
Have a drink and relax.
We can't set sail today anyway.

332
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,653
Captain. Are you sure we can go tomorrow?

333
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,573
Tomorrow's weather forecast
isn't looking good either.

334
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,116
Look.

335
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,827
I've been sailing for 30 years.

336
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,498
You think those guys who sit
in front of their computers all day

337
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,083
know the seas better than me?

338
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,795
I'll blame you
if we can't set sail tomorrow, then.

339
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
What's the rush?

340
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,217
We've been trying to find
that island for two years.

341
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,552
How will you find it now?

342
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:22,724
Well, this is a secret,
so I can't really tell you in detail.

343
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,437
But one of our friends
has been taken to that island.

344
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,483
The one who was there before?

345
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,942
What?

346
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:38,156
Wait, you know about Mr. Seong?

347
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,368
Hwang gave me a rough idea.

348
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,330
All right, then. I can just tell you.

349
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,044
His name is Seong Gi-hun.
He's a previous winner of the game.

350
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,338
He wanted to get back at those bastards,

351
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,050
so he put a GPS tracker in here
and let them take him to the island.

352
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,886
But I don't know how the intel leaked.

353
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,431
So everything Hwang told me was true?

354
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,724
Yeah!

355
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,436
I just helped him look for the island

356
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,605
because I rescued the guy from the water.

357
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,901
But, come on,
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

358
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,486
About the games, the money, and--

359
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,323
Captain, I didn't believe it
at first either.

360
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,035
But they really do exist.

361
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,538
Those masked men. I saw them.

362
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,499
They zapped me with a stun gun at a club.

363
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,252
Masked men with stun guns?

364
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,169
Yeah!

365
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,674
So that's why you brought all those men.

366
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,593
Damn.

367
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,306
They look so intimidating.
Like a bunch of sharks.

368
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,852
We're dealing with
some brutal bastards here.

369
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,937
My boss was looking for them, and...

370
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,403
Anyway, you're now
in the same boat as us, okay?

371
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,613
We live or die together.

372
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,782
Nobody is going to die.

373
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,286
I've been sailing that boat for ten years.

374
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,122
Never seen any trouble.

375
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,999
No one's even tripped once.

376
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,670
All right. I'll count on you then.

377
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,217
Welcome to your second game.

378
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,351
So the triangle is the easiest one?

379
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,771
Yes.

380
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,542
Hey. How's that a triangle?

381
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,461
Even we Marines couldn't do that!

382
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,758
This is supposed to be the easiest one?

383
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,301
What the heck is that?

384
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,304
This guy is going to get us all killed!

385
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,430
- Hey!
- I...

386
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,142
What are you going to do,
take responsibility for this?

387
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,228
You said you won!

388
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,270
You said you've done it!

389
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,855
- No, I...
- What are you going to do?

390
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,357
How will you take responsibility?

391
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:22,111
Do something!

392
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,655
I... I just...

393
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,765
Look at you.

394
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,436
Jun-hee.

395
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,355
So you really had no clue?

396
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,567
I thought you were just ignoring me.

397
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,154
Well, you've always been self-absorbed.

398
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,990
Why are you here?

399
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,199
Have you forgotten?

400
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,912
You told me to buy that coin too.

401
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,672
You...

402
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh, you haven't forgotten about this.

403
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,970
You didn't get rid of it? We agreed.

404
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,223
I'm keeping it.

405
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,476
How can you raise a baby
without any money?

406
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,978
I'm going to make money.

407
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,023
I'm going to make money,
pay off my debt, and get a place for us.

408
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,403
This baby has no father,
so its mom needs to make money.

409
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,322
That's why you're here? To make money?

410
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,950
How the hell will you survive here
in your condition?

411
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm not going to ask for your help,
so drop the act.

412
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,289
It doesn't suit you.

413
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,084
That's what you came to say?

414
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,879
No, I came to take a look
at your beat-up face.

415
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758
Serves you right.

416
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,598
Attention, please.

417
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,060
The second game will begin momentarily.

418
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,397
Please follow
the instructions from our staff.

419
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,066
Let me repeat.

420
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,069
- Let's talk about this when we get out.
- The second game will...

421
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,615
I wanted to leave.

422
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,202
I couldn't, because of you.

423
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,589
Gi-hun.

424
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,841
Triangle.

425
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm counting on you, buddy.

426
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,429
Yeah.

427
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,906
What's that?

428
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,366
You don't need to know.

429
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,244
It's time to play the game.

430
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,172
Triangle.

431
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:57,243
Welcome to your second game.

432
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,416
This game will be played in teams.

433
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,128
Please divide into teams of five
in the next ten minutes.

434
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,089
Let me repeat.

435
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,593
This game will be played in teams.

436
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,804
Please divide into teams of five
in the next ten minutes.

437
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,057
Is Dalgona a team game?

438
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,226
Aren't we playing the Dalgona game?

439
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,646
No, it doesn't look like it.

440
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,190
What's the game then?

441
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
I'm not sure.

442
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,819
What? You said you'd done this before.

443
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,322
That triangle was the easiest.
Was that all bullshit?

444
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,325
I'm sorry.

445
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
Sorry won't cut it!

446
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,204
You talked like you knew everything.

447
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,123
All these people believed your bullshit.
What are you going to do?

448
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,833
Will you take responsibility?

449
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,587
That's enough.

450
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,175
Please divide into teams now.

451
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,970
Yeah, just drop it.

452
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,181
Don't waste your time
talking to this nutjob.

453
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,934
We shouldn't have fallen for his nonsense.

454
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,938
Jesus. Come on, let's form a team first.

455
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,774
Previous winner? Damn lunatic!

456
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,777
Dalgona? Triangle? Screw you.

457
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,989
How about teaming up with me?

458
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,158
What's going on?

459
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,162
- It's not the Dalgona game?
- No, I don't think so.

460
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,831
What do we do then?

461
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,415
Let's go.

462
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,583
Go where?

463
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,921
We've got to get a move on
if we want to join a good team.

464
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,467
I'm sorry.

465
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,053
I still trust you.

466
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,059
I'd like to play the game with you,
if that's okay?

467
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,230
All right. Let's be real men
and give it a shot.

468
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,817
It's a children's game, right?
We used to play games all the time.

469
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,280
That's right, sirs. I'll join you.

470
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,241
I feel like I can do anything with you.

471
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,618
That's the Marine spirit.

472
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,706
It'd be embarrassing for brave Marines
to be carving Dalgona anyway.

473
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,792
If we're playing a game,
it should be worth risking our lives for.

474
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,129
Like Buck Buck or the Squid Game, right?

475
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,300
Yes! I will certainly
risk my life to win, sir.

476
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,387
We only need one more person then.

477
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,849
Leave it to me, sir. I'll go find someone.

478
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,269
All right, then.
Get someone who'd risk their life to win.

479
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,146
Yes, sir! Victory at all costs!

480
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,190
Go.

481
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,206
Jun-hee.

482
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,753
Let's team up.

483
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,670
No.

484
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,339
You have to join a team.

485
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,423
Not with you.

486
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,925
Stop trying to act tough.

487
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,344
Do you think
anyone would want a pregnant girl?

488
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,055
Mind your own business.
I can take care of myself.

489
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,973
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

490
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,268
But I had a tough time too.

491
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,772
You know that
all those people were out to kill me.

492
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,275
You completely ignored me for six months.
I thought you were dead.

493
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,985
All right, I'm sorry.

494
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,488
Now, let's team up.

495
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,367
You can't have the baby
unless you make it out of here alive.

496
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,662
I don't trust you.

497
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,374
You're dead to me.

498
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,430
Over there. How about him?

499
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,100
- Because he can run fast?
- Yeah.

500
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,310
I told you. It may not be a race...

501
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,730
If you need one more person, I could...

502
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,697
No, we're good.

503
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,421
Excuse me.

504
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,595
Would you like to team up with me?

505
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,643
- If it's about strength, we've got it, so...
- Excuse me.

506
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,854
If you need two people, can we join you?

507
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,107
Sure. That'd be great.

508
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,900
Where's the other person?

509
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,075
I'm sorry. You're not the kind
of people we're looking for.

510
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,369
All right.

511
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,540
We'll take you if you ditch the old lady.

512
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,085
The old lady is my mom.

513
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,760
Yong-sik, you should join them.

514
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,636
I'll find a team on my own.

515
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,098
Mom! Don't be ridiculous now.

516
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,064
Mom, why do you look so down?
You're a tough cookie.

517
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,192
Keep your head up.
Let me see that fire in your eyes!

518
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,445
Just be yourself
when you're letting me have it.

519
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,157
You little brat.
How dare you take that tone with me?

520
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,493
- You've got some nerve!
- There you go.

521
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,661
There's my mom.

522
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,247
Look, let's go ask those guys.

523
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,707
I got someone.

524
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,963
What's your name?

525
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,966
It's Park Min-su.

526
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,468
What brought you here?

527
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,636
Señorita, excuse me?

528
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,015
Let's play the game together.

529
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,477
Well, why should I?

530
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,853
Don't you know who he is?

531
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,647
He's Thanos, the rapper.

532
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,191
I'm gonna kill half of humanity
With my raps

533
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,569
Hang on, a girl?
We don't know what the game is.

534
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,905
I, Thanos the great, will protect you.

535
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,741
Right, Thanos.

536
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,202
So have you got all the Infinity Stones?

537
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,203
Of course.

538
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,791
I'm going to destroy
anyone who gets in my way!

539
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,253
Just stick with me, and you'll be safe.

540
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,421
Okay?

541
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,716
But I already asked someone to join me.

542
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,760
No problem. Who is it?

543
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,934
What's your name?

544
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,270
It's Min-su.

545
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,355
He looks like a freaking dork.

546
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,358
What's up? Nice to meet you, my brother.

547
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,277
Welcome to the Thanos world.

548
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,031
You're cute. Come on.

549
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,829
- Sir! I got someone.
- Yes.

550
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,832
He'll definitely risk his life to win.

551
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,208
Victory at all costs!

552
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,669
Hey, were you in the Marines?

553
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,005
Class 946, sir!

554
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,300
Boy, with three ex-Marines,
we'll be invincible.

555
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,218
What do you think? I like him.

556
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,095
Excuse me.

557
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,140
Please let me join your team.

558
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,101
Sorry, we've already got five people.

559
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,352
Please help me.

560
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,273
I'm pregnant.

561
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,695
Oh, your belly...

562
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,452
Team selection will end momentarily.

563
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,586
- Would you...
- Can we...

564
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,173
You insolent fools!

565
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,428
You made me come to you
when you should have come to me.

566
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,724
I should just slay you with my knife.

567
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,815
Time for team selection is up.

568
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,821
The game you will be playing
is Six-Legged Pentathlon.

569
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,158
You will start
with your legs tied together.

570
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:20,996
Each member will take turns playing
a mini-game at every ten-meter mark,

571
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,542
and if you win,
the team can move on to the next one.

572
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,168
Here are the mini-games.

573
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,337
Number one, the Ddakji.

574
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,923
Number two, Flying Stone.

575
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,259
Number three, Gong-gi.

576
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,678
Number four, Spinning Top.

577
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,222
Number five, Jegi.

578
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,100
Your goal is to win all the mini-games

579
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,396
and cross the finish line in five minutes.

580
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,899
- Please decide players for each mini-game.
-   You guys pick.

581
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,069
What are you good at?

582
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,367
It's good that we got a woman.

583
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,578
You can play Gong-gi, right?

584
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,667
Don't girls play Gong-gi anymore?

585
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,503
I've never played it.

586
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,421
Right.

587
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,133
Actually,

588
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,177
I can play Gong-gi.

589
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,346
You? An ex-Marine?

590
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,142
I grew up with four older sisters.

591
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,103
I used to play it with them
from time to time.

592
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,317
That's right.
There's nothing a Marine can't do.

593
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,154
Everyone else,
what game are you confident playing?

594
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,197
Ddakji for me.

595
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,576
At the subway station,
I won more times than the guy.

596
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,244
Okay, then.

597
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,414
Miss 222, you can play Ddakji.

598
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,624
I'll play Flying Stone.

599
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,794
I was a pitcher for my baseball team.
I'm good at throwing.

600
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,881
That leaves Jegi and Spinning Top.

601
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,133
Which are you good at?

602
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,259
Well,

603
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,970
I'll play what you pick for me, Gi-hun.

604
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,098
You know my name?

605
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:10,356
Oh, your friend was calling you
by your name, so I thought I'd try it.

606
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,858
Does it bother you?

607
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,237
No, it's fine.

608
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,824
So, Gi-hun, which are you good at?

609
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,997
I guess I'm better at Jegi.

610
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,376
Then I'll do Spinning Top.

611
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,462
- All right.
- Guys, bring your hands together.

612
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,214
All together now!

613
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,425
On three, we go, "Victory at all costs."

614
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,635
One, two, three.

615
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,844
Victory at all costs!

616
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,099
Teams one and two, get ready.

617
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,737
- Let's go!
- Come on!

618
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,740
Let the game begin.

619
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,200
Let's get it.

620
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:11,041
- One, two!
- One, two!

621
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,752
Stay calm.

622
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,217
Pass.

623
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:25,347
- Ready, go! One, two!
- One, two!

624
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,268
Fail.

625
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,937
- One, two!
- One, two!

626
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,274
Throw it! Take your time.

627
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,276
Please do not step over the line.

628
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,408
Shit!

629
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,785
Another stone.

630
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,495
- What?
- What the hell?

631
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,580
- Come on!
- Go!

632
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,791
- Ready, go! One, two!
- One, two!

633
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,709
Get it!

634
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,087
Come on, hurry!

635
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,761
A miss in Flying Stone
will eat up a lot of time.

636
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,685
Pass.

637
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:20,152
- One, two!
- One, two!

638
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,571
For Gong-gi, you must pass all stages

639
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,866
and catch all five stones at the end.

640
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,534
All five stones at once. Sit.

641
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,744
- Sit.
- Careful.

642
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,294
We don't have time! Hurry!

643
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,380
We can still make it. Stay calm and focus!

644
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,507
- You got this.
- Yeah.

645
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,591
We can still make it.

646
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,177
How can you miss?

647
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,094
Let's go!

648
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,471
- One, two!
- One, two!

649
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,150
- All at once!
- Get them all!

650
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,739
Fail.

651
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,825
- Please start over.
- Dae-ho.

652
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,244
- Practice the flip.
- The flip?

653
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:17,835
- You can do this! Just relax and throw!
- You can do it!

654
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,256
You son of a bitch!
How could you miss that?

655
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,299
- You said you were good!
- Come on, let's go!

656
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,385
- Come on!
- Goddamnit!

657
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,304
- One, two!
- One, two!

658
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,641
- That's it.
- Okay.

659
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,352
Good. That's it!

660
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,855
- Yes!
- You did it!

661
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,398
- Finish it.
- Finish it.

662
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,859
- Finish it.
- Come on, do it!

663
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,110
Shut up!

664
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,908
She did it!

665
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,826
Pass.

666
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,498
Go!

667
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,586
- Hurry up!
- Come on! We have no time!

668
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,257
Take it easy!

669
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,676
- You can do it!
- Come on!

670
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,390
- Fail.
- It was a hit!

671
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,350
You stepped over the line.

672
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
You stepped over the line?

673
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:21,231
You idiot!
You stepped over the goddamn line!

674
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,650
- We don't have time! We've got to go!
- Damn you!

675
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,403
- Hurry!
- One, two!

676
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,574
- One, two!
- Hurry!

677
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,503
- Shit.
- Come on.

678
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,963
- It's okay.
- We have time.

679
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,298
Calm down. Try again.

680
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:47,966
Okay.

681
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,388
Please.

682
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:01,939
Damn you.
You're going to get us all killed.

683
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,234
Damn it. Come on.

684
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,373
- Shit.
- Come on.

685
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,000
- We've got to go!
- Pick it up quickly!

686
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,043
Shit.

687
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,547
- Get it!
- Hurry up!

688
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,718
With Spinning Top,
it'll take even longer if you mess up.

689
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,811
Do you really know how to spin a top?

690
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,897
If you're not confident,
you can switch places with me...

691
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,527
Only the gods of heaven and earth
decide where I go.

692
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,737
You fools can stay where you are.

693
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,157
Why does this skank
keep talking down to us?

694
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,661
Does she think shamans
are just allowed to be rude?

695
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,250
Hurry.

696
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,171
- I did it!
- Pass.

697
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,093
I did it.

698
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,847
And I didn't step over the line.

699
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,974
You goddamn idiot.

700
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,058
Pass.

701
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,353
- Go!
- Come on!

702
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,314
Come on, let's go.

703
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,608
- Wait.
- No!

704
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,901
- Please!
- No!

705
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,864
Your time is up.

706
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,759
The following players
have been eliminated.

707
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,846
Players 016, 045, 178, 189,

708
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:03,143
198, 254, 286, 341,

709
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,021
395, and 416.

710
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,525
We should have left!
We're all going to die now!

711
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,820
We're all going to die
because of those who voted to continue!

712
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,822
What are you going to do now?

713
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,575
- You think you can survive?
- Look at them!

714
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,744
- What?
- You killed them.

715
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,622
Can you...
Can you please give me one of those?

716
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,665
-"Those"?
- The thing you took.

717
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,251
You're keeping them inside your cross.

718
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,339
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

719
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,550
If I get nervous
and lose the game, we'll all die.

720
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,054
My hands are shaking like crazy.

721
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,931
- Attention, please.
- Nam-su.

722
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,057
- Players.
- It's Nam-gyu.

723
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,394
- Right. Nam-gyu.
- Please wait while we tidy up the venue.

724
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,396
Do you know what this is?

725
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,108
Ecstasy? Ketamine?

726
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,113
It's a new kind. It's fucking crazy, man.
You can't handle it.

727
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,322
Hey.

728
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,703
I did all kinds of stuff
when I was working at the club.

729
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:08,583
I even brought you some
when you came to the club.

730
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,133
You junkie.

731
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,391
What?

732
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,601
Nothing.

733
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,396
What's your name again?

734
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,898
It's Min-su.

735
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:32,816
Min-su.

736
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,903
Min-su. What's that famous quote
by Admiral Yi Sun-sin?

737
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,242
"Those seeking life shall croak.
Those seeking death shall live."

738
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:47,122
So don't be scared. Just tell yourself
that you don't care if you die.

739
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,333
Then we'll survive, win the money,
and get the fuck out.

740
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,879
Hey, mind your own business.

741
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,547
Me?

742
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,757
Yes, you. Mr. Shaky Hands.

743
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,301
What's with the attitude?

744
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,596
We shouldn't have picked a girl.
She's got an attitude.

745
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,057
You're a prick
who had to pop a pill for his nerves.

746
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,058
Fucking bitch.

747
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,438
Attention, please.

748
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:16,693
Players, please wait
while we tidy up the venue.

749
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,480
Open it.

750
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,859
That's an order.

751
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,784
Please don't...

752
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,433
The next teams, please get ready.

753
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,448
Look at me.

754
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,160
I'm Hyun-ju. Cho Hyun-ju.

755
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,371
What's your name?

756
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,040
It's Young-mi.

757
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,627
Kim Young-mi.

758
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:05,176
Young-mi, when you spoke to me earlier,
I could tell right away.

759
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,929
I could tell how brave you are.

760
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,017
So you've got to believe in yourself.

761
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,644
Can you do that?

762
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,190
I'll try.

763
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,905
That's right. I, Jang Geum-ja,
survived the Korean War.

764
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,117
I will not die playing some kids' games.

765
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,788
Everyone.
Let's pull ourselves together and do this.

766
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,667
I'm the son of Ms. Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

767
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,669
I'm Park Yong-sik.

768
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,882
Ma'am, what's your name?

769
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,052
I'm Seon-nyeo,

770
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,679
shaman of the sea.

771
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,355
I believe we can do this.

772
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,941
Let's show everyone else here

773
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:07,113
that these games are no big deal.

774
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,497
- Teams three and four, get ready.
- Dear gods of heaven and earth...

775
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:23,588
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please guide me through this trial...

776
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,947
