00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,976
- One, two.
- One, two.

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,437
- One, two.
- One, two.

3
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,527
Go. Get it.

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,946
All right, throw it hard.

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,574
Fail.

6
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,993
Come on, again. Smash it!

7
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,203
Fail.

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,831
All right.

9
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,625
Fail.

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,796
What are you doing?
Pick it up and throw it!

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,177
Hang on, Young-mi.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,096
Try it with the other side.
The other side.

13
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,477
Go. Here we go.

14
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,562
Pass.

15
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,564
Great job.

16
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,026
- Yes! All right!
- You did it!

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,361
- Well done. Let's go.
- Thank God!

18
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,155
Ready, go!

19
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,243
I can't watch. It's making me anxious.

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,291
Okay.

21
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,632
There.

22
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,512
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay.

23
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,098
All right, we'll go pick it up.

24
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,274
All right, now walk backwards.

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,322
We could save some time
walking backwards like that.

26
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,574
They're actually faster going backwards.

27
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,201
All right.

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,081
Here we go. Come on.

29
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,624
Yong-sik, look.

30
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:09,212
Imagine the stone is the face
of the crook who scammed you.

31
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,719
That asshole ruined my fucking life!

32
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,596
Pass.

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,306
Way to go!

34
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,310
They can do it.

35
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,102
Old hag! What are you doing--

36
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,399
You said you played Gong-gi
with bullets during the Korean War.

37
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,680
Mom, just imagine

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,392
the stone is Dad's mistress' face.

39
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,566
Rotten bitch!

40
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,742
- Pass.
- She did it! Go!

41
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,622
Dad!

42
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
All right. Ready?

43
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,548
Hurry! One, two!

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,147
You have to wrap it around the axle first.

45
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,024
I know.

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,288
Don't look at the clock. We've got time.

47
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,045
Are you sure you've done this before?

48
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,547
Stop talking to me.

49
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,802
Take it easy.

50
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
- Take it easy.
- Shut her up!

51
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,934
God, it's taking too long.

52
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,687
No, she should do it like...

53
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,024
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

54
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,194
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

55
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:27,410
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please have mercy on me.

56
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,328
Dear...

57
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,210
The gods of heaven and earth
have abandoned us.

58
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,422
- She's completely out of it.
- She can't be.

59
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,506
They've abandoned us.

60
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,759
Am I going to die here?

61
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,469
Get yourself together.

62
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,845
We're all going to die--

63
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,310
If you give up,

64
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,395
I will kill you before your gods do.

65
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,442
Hurry up.

66
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,486
Hurry!

67
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,504
Pass.

68
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,387
- Go!
- Come on!

69
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,348
- Hurry.
- One, two!

70
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,274
Hurry!

71
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,028
You must kick the jegi five times.

72
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,238
Please, look away.

73
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,406
- What?
- Please.

74
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,033
- Yeah, all right.
- You guys too.

75
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,204
Don't look! Turn around, guys!

76
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,171
One.

77
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,216
Two.

78
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,718
Three.

79
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,179
Four.

80
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,480
- Five!
- Five!

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,648
Pass.

82
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,212
SQUID GAME 2

83
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,382
EPISODE 5
ONE MORE GAME

84
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,145
You motherfucker!

85
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,148
...two, three, four, five!

86
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,744
One, two, three, four, five!

87
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,334
Last teams, get ready.

88
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,014
It's a little sad that
we have no audience, isn't it?

89
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,767
Hey, are you scared?

90
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,435
No, sir!

91
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,191
It's quiet and easier to focus
without anyone watching.

92
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,402
Guys!

93
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,406
We'll see you again at the finish line!
Victory at all costs!

94
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,659
Yes! We'll see each other again!

95
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,994
- Yes, thank you!
- We'll see you again!

96
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,412
- That's right!
- Good luck!

97
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,040
All right. Let's get ready.

98
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,337
I believe in our team.

99
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,966
Plus, we have the previous winner with us.

100
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,565
We're here.

101
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,948
- Pass.
- You did it!

102
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,116
Ready, go!

103
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,377
Okay.

104
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,462
Let's get this done the first time!
I believe in you!

105
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,006
When I played baseball,
my pitches might've been slow,

106
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
but I had flawless ball control.

107
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,348
- Yes! You did it!
- Pass.

108
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,433
Ready, go!

109
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,354
I knew you could do it!

110
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,897
Let's stay calm!

111
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,777
All right.

112
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,410
Dae-ho, stay calm. Even if you mess up...

113
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,352
Pass.

114
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,731
That was amazing! Dae-ho, my boy!

115
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,691
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

116
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,109
Ready, go!

117
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,280
We've got plenty of time!

118
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,075
You're expecting, so be careful.

119
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,799
There's no rush. Take your time.

120
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,052
Damn, we might get through everything
on the first attempt.

121
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,359
It's okay, we've got enough time.

122
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,528
Let's go pick it up. Ready, go.

123
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,322
No fun passing everything without a hitch.

124
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,660
That's right.
You can't grow without failure, right?

125
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,246
Now backwards. Ready, go.

126
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,004
- God.
- All right.

127
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,507
It's okay. Just stay calm.

128
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,511
Excuse me.

129
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,477
Fail.

130
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,856
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

131
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,984
Let's go pick it up. All right, let's go.

132
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,238
You sure you did this a lot as a kid?

133
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,949
Throwing it backwards, now that's a skill.

134
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,918
Get up.
Are you taking a break or something?

135
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,463
Now forward. Ready, go!

136
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,217
Hang on.

137
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,427
Let me do this.

138
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,347
What the hell is the problem?

139
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,433
Stay calm, okay?

140
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,731
Don't rush it. No!

141
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,941
- Damn it!
- Fail.

142
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,740
- We still have time--
- What the hell is wrong with me?

143
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,997
You goddamn idiot! You're an idiot!

144
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,792
No one is blaming you!

145
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,420
All right. Take a deep breath, okay?

146
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,633
Try to remember the times
when you had fun playing this.

147
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,926
Now, deep breaths.

148
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,431
Deep breaths. Calm down.

149
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,267
It's okay.

150
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:39,021
Take your time, okay? Stay calm.

151
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,731
All right.

152
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,663
Let's go! Ready, go!

153
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
How are you holding up?

154
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,129
Are you okay?

155
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
Okay, move.

156
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:19,186
One, two, three, four...

157
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,611
You did it!

158
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,658
- Pass.
- Let's go!

159
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,826
Ready, go!

160
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,953
One, two! Quickly!

161
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,706
We're almost there!

162
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,340
- We did it!
- Well done!

163
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,099
The following players
have been eliminated.

164
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,145
Players 135, 239,

165
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:05,149
263, 415...

166
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,906
Fuck, way too many are still alive.

167
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,411
Hey.

168
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,290
How many do you think are left?

169
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,583
Sorry?

170
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,838
How many roaches
do you think we have left in here?

171
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,387
About 200.

172
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,722
How do you know?

173
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,265
What are you, an AI bot?

174
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,225
Go count them.

175
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,894
Now?

176
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

177
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,318
Why do you want to count them?
Are you stupid?

178
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,905
The masked men will come and tell us soon.

179
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,406
Shut up, bitch.

180
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,324
Stop it.

181
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,787
- What's your name again?
- It's Min-su.

182
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,080
How old are you?

183
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,207
I'm 27.

184
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,000
So you were born in 1997.

185
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,711
Why do you treat him like he's your boss?

186
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,004
He's the same age as you.

187
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,007
- Nam-su, isn't that right?
- It's Nam-gyu.

188
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,052
- Yes, Nam-gyu. Isn't that right?
- Yes.

189
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,179
You're the same age.
Treat him like a friend.

190
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,057
We'll work better as a team that way.
Okay?

191
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:21,975
How old are you?

192
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,310
Born in 1998.

193
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,229
You?

194
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,188
Born in 1996.

195
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
It's settled.

196
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,654
Gyeong-su is the youngest,
you're the same age, and you're older.

197
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,866
Hey, call her noona since she's older.

198
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,245
Do it.

199
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,748
Unnie.

200
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,836
Can I ask you something?

201
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,421
Yes.

202
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,343
How did you know it'd be easier
to flip the ddakji with the other side?

203
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:05,477
I used to play Ddakji
with my friends when I was a kid.

204
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,773
And that was my secret trick.

205
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,984
I see.

206
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,821
Listen, can I ask you something too?

207
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,738
Yes.

208
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:22,327
When you were playing Jegi,
how come you didn't want us to look?

209
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,829
Oh.

210
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,583
Well, I...

211
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,378
Are you shy?

212
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,463
It's not that.

213
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm just not completely done.

214
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,303
What do you mean?

215
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,764
Mom, stop asking questions.
You're being nosy.

216
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,600
It's all right.

217
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
I still have some procedures left.

218
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,025
I just didn't want people to stare at me.

219
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,484
What procedures?

220
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,700
Oh, so that's how
you got yourself those too?

221
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,828
Of course. I knew they were too big--

222
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,246
Mom, please!

223
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,081
I'm so sorry.

224
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,921
What? We have more survivors?

225
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,840
It's that nutjob's team.

226
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,221
Goddamnit. There's going to be a big drop
in the prize money they add.

227
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,515
- That young lady made it.
- Who?

228
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,643
The tiny young lady.

229
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,645
They don't seem so happy to see us.

230
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,400
That sweet old lady.

231
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,653
I miss my mom.

232
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,334
The day's work has been completed.

233
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,797
All soldiers,
please proceed to your quarters.

234
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,165
I thought you'd be a total freak,
but you actually have a decent face.

235
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,917
North Korean girls are pretty.

236
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,169
What the hell is this?
You're breaking the rules.

237
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,046
Rules, my ass.

238
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,674
You should've steered clear
if you weren't going to help.

239
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,384
I'm going to report this.

240
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
To whom? The officer?

241
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,892
How long do you think he'll protect you?

242
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,853
He's already cut you loose.

243
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,359
Do you want me
to explain it to you in detail?

244
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,279
The situation you're in right now?

245
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,212
Fuck. You damn commie.

246
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,510
Shall I ruin your face?

247
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,600
Or shall I cut your fingers off
so you can't pull the trigger anymore?

248
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,356
Last warning.

249
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,317
If you get in our way again,

250
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,571
I will cut off all your fingers
and throw them in the incinerator.

251
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,115
And play with you a little too.

252
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,138
I'm sorry about earlier, everyone.

253
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,890
No, it's okay.

254
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,849
Don't be.

255
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,020
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have made the last kick.

256
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,567
Player 222, are you feeling all right?

257
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,111
Yes.

258
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,740
Thank you all
for letting me be on your team.

259
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,161
She smashed that ddakji
and flipped it on her first try.

260
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,080
That was impressive.

261
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,332
She did great, even while carrying a baby.

262
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,168
We were lucky she joined our team.

263
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,879
What about your Flying Stone play?

264
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,881
You hit it with one shot.

265
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,926
With an underhand pitch at that. Bam!

266
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,346
You were like Kim Byung-hyun.

267
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,766
And you? Was Gong-gi
the only game you ever played?

268
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,271
I could barely see your hand.
It was like a martial arts movie.

269
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,731
I'm the only son for two generations.

270
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,818
My mom only let me play at home
with my sisters.

271
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,029
And yet they let their precious son
join the Marines?

272
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,077
My father's idea,
he wanted me to be more of a man.

273
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,496
He fought in the Vietnam War, you see.

274
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,583
- He sounds like a great man.
- Yeah.

275
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,293
Was he a Marine too?

276
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,671
Yeah, well...
Would you excuse me for a moment?

277
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,343
Listen. Perhaps we should learn
each other's names.

278
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,556
I still don't know your names, gentlemen.
Or yours, Miss.

279
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,727
I'll start. I'm Kang Dae-ho.

280
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,812
"Dae" means "big," "ho" means "tiger."

281
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,231
"Big tiger." Cool name.

282
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,442
My name is Park Jung-bae.

283
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,861
"Righteous" and "twice."

284
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,906
My parents wanted me
to be twice as righteous.

285
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,033
My name is Kim Jun-hee.

286
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,036
I don't know what it means though.

287
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,707
Jun-hee. When you get out of here,
go see a doctor right away.

288
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,336
You've been under a lot of stress.
You need to get yourself checked out.

289
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,670
Okay.

290
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,672
I'm Oh Young-il.

291
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,715
-"Young-il"?
- Yes.

292
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,511
"Young-il" sounds like "zero one,"
and that's my number.

293
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,138
Easy to remember.

294
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,724
Oh, that's true! Your name is your number.

295
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,853
Oh, Gi-hun. What's your last name?

296
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,648
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

297
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,899
- I see.
- Seong Gi-hun.

298
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,235
"Seong" literally means "last name."

299
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:49,589
Congratulations to all of you
for making it through the second game.

300
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:54,719
Here are the results of the second game.

301
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,255
In the second game,
110 players were eliminated.

302
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,883
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 20.1 billion won.

303
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,344
Since there are 255 players remaining,

304
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:41,474
each person's share is 78,823,530 won.

305
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,934
Wait, what?

306
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,271
It's still under 100 million?
It's not even 80 million.

307
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,693
Only 110 people died? Is that all?

308
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,279
Did you count them right?

309
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,824
That's all? But you shot all those people!

310
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,118
- It was more than that!
- Count them again!

311
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,913
Fuck. I almost died twice,
and that's all I get?

312
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,293
I'd get more money than that
if I let somebody beat me up!

313
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,047
I completely understand
your disappointment.

314
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:17,427
However, we always keep the door open
for you to pursue new opportunities.

315
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:23,808
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

316
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:39,449
Whether to continue the games
for a bigger prize or to stop here

317
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,410
is entirely your choice.

318
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,913
Please feel free

319
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,417
to exercise your right to choose
in a democratic manner.

320
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,589
- Yong-sik.
- Yeah?

321
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,383
If we go home today,

322
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,387
let's have kimchi stew.
I'll make it with some aged kimchi.

323
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,597
With a lot of pork, right?

324
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,808
I suddenly feel hungry.

325
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,144
Listen, I think it's more than
a coincidence that we met here.

326
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:14,025
If we get out, I'd like to invite you
to our house for a meal.

327
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,694
We'll grill some pork belly.

328
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,531
Would that be okay?

329
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,700
Absolutely!

330
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,830
We live in a small place, but there is
enough space for four people to eat.

331
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,749
There's space for you to lie down.
You can sleep over.

332
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,880
Unnie, are you coming?

333
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
By the way, where do you all live?

334
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,065
We live in Bongcheon-dong.

335
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,484
Really? I live in Sillim-dong.

336
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,779
Goodness, we're practically neighbors!

337
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,990
What about you, Hyun-ju?
Do you live in Seoul?

338
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,117
I live in Gwangmyeong.

339
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,704
My! That's only a 30-minute bus ride away.

340
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,956
I'm surprised we all live
so close together.

341
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,418
We must have a special connection.
This is amazing.

342
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,017
Don't worry.

343
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,144
I want to stop here too.

344
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,440
I should go and be with my wife
at the hospital.

345
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,613
I'm telling you. We'll get out this time.

346
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,282
Damn it.

347
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,827
A Marine should think strategically
and know when to retreat.

348
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,829
Isn't that right, brother?

349
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,916
Yeah, you're right.

350
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:57,128
Marines aren't invincible.
We should get out.

351
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,589
We have to end the games here.

352
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,635
I will help you guys out when we get out.

353
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,806
Please trust me and support this vote.

354
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,810
Guys, all huddle up again.

355
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,734
- In 1, 2, 3. Victory at all costs!
- Victory at all costs!

356
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,283
This time,
the vote will begin with Player 001.

357
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,869
Player 001, please cast your vote.

358
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,516
Player 006.

359
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,903
Player 007.

360
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,866
Excuse me.

361
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,783
Yong-sik.

362
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,203
Don't get any foolish ideas.

363
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,331
If we put our money together,

364
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
it'd be over 150 million.

365
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,087
We'll pay off your debt with it

366
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:25,758
and use the rest to open
a produce store or something. Okay?

367
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,865
Hurry up! Are you doing a goddamn ritual?

368
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
Shut your mouth!

369
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,272
Don't betray us.

370
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,691
What?

371
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,568
- This.
- Player 048.

372
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,280
We all agreed
to play one more game, right?

373
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah.

374
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,497
Player 125.

375
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,691
Player 126.

376
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,696
Excuse me.

377
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,655
Everyone!

378
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,240
Are you all out of your minds?

379
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,081
You still want to keep going
after watching all those people die?

380
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,584
Who's to say you won't die
in the next game?

381
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,422
We have to stop.

382
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,633
We'll all die if we keep going!

383
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,345
Come to your senses,
and leave with that money.

384
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,682
You've got to survive first,
or there won't be a next step.

385
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,437
What do you think
we can do with a mere 70 million?

386
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,776
I don't know how much you owe,
but for most people here,

387
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,239
that doesn't even cover 10% of their debt.

388
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,573
Am I right?

389
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,326
There's no next step for us!

390
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,245
That money won't change anything!

391
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,747
- Yes, he's right!
- That's right!

392
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,209
With that amount of money,
I won't last long.

393
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,254
It was 25 million after the first game,

394
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,422
and now it's 78 million!

395
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:37,885
After one game,
the amount more than tripled!

396
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,638
If we play one more game,

397
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,144
the prize will be at least 240 million!

398
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,479
But I can't do this anymore.

399
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,190
Please.

400
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,111
Please let me out of here.

401
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,488
I really...

402
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,951
I really want to go home.

403
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,121
I don't want to die.

404
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,835
Young lady.

405
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,007
You're young, so you'd probably have
another chance.

406
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,885
But I don't.

407
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,720
Please.

408
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,015
My family and I have no future.

409
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,769
My business failed,
and now I owe over 500 million.

410
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,398
I've got to make
at least half of that here

411
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,651
if I want a real shot at a fresh start.

412
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,861
What if you die?

413
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,865
If you die here, your family
won't even get your body.

414
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,494
Then it'd be the end
for you and your family!

415
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,290
- Don't you see?
- Don't get fucking scared!

416
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,920
Ddakji, Red Light, Green Light,
Spinning Top!

417
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,048
It's not like the games
are that difficult.

418
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,841
Look.

419
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,594
There are still 255 players.

420
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,680
Way more than half of us survived!

421
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,851
We've made it this far,
so let's do this one more time!

422
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,063
You make such a good point, young man.

423
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,648
That's right!

424
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:18,986
We've all played the games well
and are still standing!

425
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,198
Now, let's play one more game!

426
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:27,078
Just one more, and that's it.
Let's play just one more game!

427
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,829
Yeah, let's play one more game!

428
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,248
One more game!

429
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:35,253
- One more game!
- One more game!

430
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,139
The results are 139 for O and 116 for X.

431
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:34,186
Based on the majority vote,
we'll proceed to the third game tomorrow.

432
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,771
Thank you.

433
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,197
Thank you.

434
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,325
Thank you.

435
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,132
Noona.

436
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,388
Aren't you scared?

437
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,305
Scared of what?

438
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,475
Playing more games.

439
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,187
I am scared.

440
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,858
Then why do you want to continue?

441
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,740
Because if I go out now,

442
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,827
I'll have to face even scarier things.

443
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,043
Don't call me noona.

444
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,462
I'm younger than you,
but don't tell those jerks.

445
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,807
Mom. Are you angry?

446
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,892
Don't call me "Mom," you damn fool.

447
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,731
Mom. I'm sorry,
but I can't go home with just that.

448
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,781
What do you mean?

449
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
I have a little more debt.

450
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,708
How much?

451
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,294
About 100 million.

452
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,841
I borrowed it from loan sharks
and the gambling den.

453
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,760
If I don't pay them back by next month,

454
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,138
I'll be in huge trouble.

455
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:20,478
They said they'd take and sell
my eyes, liver, and kidneys.

456
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,688
I know they'll actually do it.

457
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,317
That's why
I haven't been able to come home.

458
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,905
Just one more game.

459
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,032
Next time, I promise I'll vote to leave.

460
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,784
After one more game,
I'll be able to pay off all my debts.

461
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,786
We'll make a fresh start then. Okay?

462
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,540
Yong-sik. "Next time"?

463
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,210
"Fresh start"?

464
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:51,926
What if one of us gets killed before that?

465
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,678
I know...

466
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,766
maybe you'd be fine without me.

467
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,939
But if something happens to you...

468
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:12,655
I wouldn't have a reason to live,
even if I make it out of here.

469
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,617
Why would you say such a thing?

470
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,537
We'll get through this together.

471
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,336
Brother!

472
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,965
Brother Jung-bae!

473
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,302
Man...

474
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,223
Hey, just come back here.

475
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,226
- No, I'm good here.
- Oh, come on.

476
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,770
- But... Hey.
- All right.

477
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,772
You should've gone farther away then.

478
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,025
It bugs me seeing you
sitting there all pathetic.

479
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,198
I'm sorry.

480
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,702
Jun-hee, Young-il. I'm sorry.

481
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,455
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

482
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,751
I borrowed some emergency cash,

483
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,421
and the creditors are harassing
my ex-wife and kid.

484
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,048
If I play one more game,

485
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,259
I think I'll be able to settle my debt.

486
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,802
- So--
- Jung-bae.

487
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,680
You of all people shouldn't have done it.

488
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,433
It's not twice as righteous.

489
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,898
But, looking at the results,
even if you had voted against,

490
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,276
we would still have been outvoted.

491
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,696
Right? It's not entirely my fault.

492
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,989
All right. To be honest,

493
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,743
I understand why you did it.

494
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,830
The money isn't enough for me either,
so when I went up to vote,

495
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,791
I did think about playing one more game.

496
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,709
You did?

497
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,002
I said I get it.

498
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,005
Thank you for understanding.

499
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,176
But I voted in favor
partly because I feel confident.

500
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,595
We did so well as a team, didn't we?

501
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,099
If we stick together one more time,
I'm sure we'll be fine. Jun-hee.

502
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,727
I'll make sure we survive the next game--

503
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,853
"The next game"?

504
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,981
In the next game,

505
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,068
we might have to kill each other.

506
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,198
Gi-hun, that's a bit much.

507
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,037
There's nothing we can do now,
so let's try to stay positive.

508
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:29,541
We should eat, pull ourselves together,
and try our best again.

509
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,129
Here, Jun-hee. You can have mine too.
Hang in there until the next game.

510
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
- No, it's okay.
- Take it.

511
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,385
I don't drink plain milk.

512
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,723
Thank you.

513
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,058
Have my bread too.

514
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,851
I don't deserve to eat.

515
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,729
I'll take your milk then.

516
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,120
It wasn't just me.

517
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,082
Oh, look. See?
I'm not the only one who voted in favor--

518
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,382
Hyun-ju, why did you do it?

519
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,593
We said we were all going
to get together at my house.

520
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,179
Why did you change your mind?

521
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,142
I wouldn't think you'd have
gambling debts like my son.

522
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,647
Is it because of the surgery?
Does it cost that much?

523
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,611
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

524
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,906
I can't even keep
my own child under control,

525
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:47,202
so who am I to tell you anything?

526
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,711
I...

527
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,676
Everything was fine
until I told people who I really am.

528
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,722
People would look at me strangely,

529
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,600
but I never had any big issues.

530
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,644
But...

531
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,149
once I told people
I wanted to live as a woman

532
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,735
and started transitioning,

533
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,529
everything changed.

534
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,163
My mom cried a lot.

535
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,875
And my father stopped talking to me.

536
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,632
I got fired from my job,
and lost all my friends.

537
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,677
I wasn't done with
the treatment and procedures,

538
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,390
but I wasn't earning any money,
so my debt kept piling up.

539
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,976
Although I felt liberated,

540
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,312
my life...

541
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,690
became so much harder.

542
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,150
Oh, dear.

543
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:06,949
Well, what did you do for work before?

544
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,827
I was in the army.

545
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:17,209
If you make money here, then what?

546
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,877
Do you have a plan?

547
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,256
I think I'm going to move to Thailand.

548
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,257
Thailand?

549
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,928
I want to play just one more game.
If I win the money...

550
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,809
I'll finish my transition there
and buy a small house.

551
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,812
I want to start a new life there.

552
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,856
I've been to Thailand before.

553
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,984
There are a lot of people
like Hyun-ju over there.

554
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:46,780
They're hotter and more beautiful
than most women,

555
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,992
and you see them everywhere.
Isn't that right?

556
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:54,663
Yeah. I hear a lot of them
are really beautiful.

557
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,958
You're beautiful too, unnie.

558
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,975
I don't know if I could say "beautiful,"

559
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,769
but I've spent some time with you now,

560
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,481
and I think you look fine.

561
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,359
You said she was unsightly.

562
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,571
Hey.

563
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,086
You traitor.

564
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,256
How can you take a piss
under these circumstances?

565
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:53,013
Just finish. You'll get an infection
if you stop mid-stream.

566
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,696
Were you really trying to get out?

567
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,657
What can you even do with 70 million?

568
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,369
That's not even enough to pay me back.

569
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,747
You need to pay me back, and also

570
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,250
compensate for the damage
you did to my soul.

571
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,252
How many times do I have to tell you?

572
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,588
That coin's price did go up.

573
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,674
You held out for more cash
but didn't sell at the right time.

574
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,093
And I have the freedom
to decide if I want to leave.

575
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,303
I don't care for your fucking tone.

576
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,223
Hey, should I just rip his mouth off?

577
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
You have the freedom?

578
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,435
- You don't have such a thing.
- Goddamnit.

579
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,063
You're my slave until you pay me back.

580
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,606
My slave.

581
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,776
So you have to keep playing
the games until the end.

582
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,860
And who knows?

583
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,072
You might win the entire prize alone.

584
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,784
Then I will get my money back

585
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,538
And you will get your happiness back

586
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,000
If I won the prize alone,
that'd mean you're dead.

587
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,752
Why would I pay you back if you were dead?

588
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,089
How do you even remember your lyrics?

589
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,216
Oh, right.

590
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,760
You forgot the lyrics
in the show's finale.

591
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,722
You son of a bitch. Got a death wish?

592
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,724
I didn't even eat anything, so why...

593
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,401
I'm watching you.

594
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,658
Are those guys still bullying you?

595
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,328
If they keep doing that,
you can ask for our help.

596
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,288
I'm fine.

597
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,386
Lights out in ten minutes.

598
00:50:56,386 --> 00:51:00,891
- Please prepare for bedtime.
- Pass it to me.

599
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,267
Go under.

600
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,443
Is this really necessary?

601
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,445
I don't like sleeping under there.

602
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:17,115
Once the lights go out,
somebody might attack us.

603
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,034
What? Who?

604
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,578
The prize money still goes up
if we kill each other.

605
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,164
It's part of the game they designed.

606
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,250
Gi-hun, I think you're overreacting here.

607
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,420
Even if that were true,
people wouldn't do that.

608
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,047
In the previous games,

609
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,717
dozens of people
killed each other at night.

610
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,053
Right here.

611
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,931
You have no idea

612
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,808
how people can change...

613
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,603
in this place.

614
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:53,026
All right, I guess I didn't know
what I was talking about. I'm sorry.

615
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,282
We need to take turns keeping watch
after lights-out.

616
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,870
I'll take the first watch.
You should decide the order for the rest.

617
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,311
Where are you going?

618
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,981
To the bathroom.

619
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,402
You always go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

620
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,446
Should I come with you?

621
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:43,493
No. Why would you want to come
to the ladies' room?

622
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,370
Will you be okay alone?

623
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,292
I'm a little scared of the people here.

624
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,675
Look.

625
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,348
Whoa.

626
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,350
- What...
- Listen.

627
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,312
This is the binyeo
your grandmother gave me.

628
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,733
I put it in just in case
I need to protect myself.

629
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,862
If somebody messes with me, I'll just go...

630
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,489
Of course.

631
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,994
Madam Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

632
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,206
Very impressive, ma'am.

633
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:36,963
Mr. Seong.

634
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,551
I need to use the bathroom.

635
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,387
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

636
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,015
We can go together.

637
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,282
We need to use the bathroom.

638
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,077
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

639
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:11,581
Please. I'm not feeling very well.

640
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,917
No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

641
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,918
Look.

642
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,337
Mr. Triangle.

643
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:23,426
Even though you're wearing a weird mask,
you're still human, aren't you?

644
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:28,139
In the outside world,
you might have a sister like her

645
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,433
and a mom like me.

646
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,854
When ladies say
they need to use the bathroom,

647
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,692
it's for reasons they can't tell you.

648
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,986
If you can't understand that,

649
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:45,198
you shouldn't even call yourself human.
You really shouldn't.

650
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,953
Listen.

651
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,333
Ever since I entered my 60s,
I've had bladder control issues.

652
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:58,295
I can't go out without wearing a diaper,

653
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,214
but I couldn't bring
any of the things I need here.

654
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,759
Do you really have to make me wet myself?

655
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,264
Imagine if I was your mother,
Mr. Triangle.

656
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,017
You wouldn't do that to your mother.

657
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,854
I came here because of my son's debt.

658
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,606
I should at least get to pee
when I want, shouldn't I?

659
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,402
What did I do
in my previous life to deserve...

660
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,574
Well, thank you.

661
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,660
Can I come too?

662
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,370
Oh, that's okay.

663
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,206
She's a woman. Her name is Hyun-ju.

664
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,959
It's fine. Let's go.

665
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,628
Come quick.

666
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,590
Thank you, Mr. Triangle.

667
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:51,264
Hold on to me if you need help.

668
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,226
I'm okay.

669
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,775
In a place like this in your condition...

670
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,778
Your mom and dad must be worried sick.

671
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,655
I don't have any.

672
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,575
I have no parents.

673
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,295
Listen.

674
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,715
If you need help with anything,
just let me know.

675
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,386
I'm okay.

676
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,352
Is she sick or something?

677
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,564
She's pregnant.

678
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,276
I think she's almost due.

679
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,672
Gi-hun, I'm up.

680
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,220
You should get some sleep. I'll take over.

681
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,305
I'm not that tired.

682
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,308
Get some more sleep.

683
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,946
I'm sorry.

684
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,198
Let's not talk about it.

685
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,243
I know it wasn't your fault.

686
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,829
No, it's not about that.

687
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,171
I'm sorry I didn't lend you money
when you came to my pub before.

688
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,427
If I had found some way to help you,
your mom might still be alive now.

689
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,598
Man, but I really
didn't have any money then.

690
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,561
I know.

691
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,023
I've never resented you for that.

692
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,778
Is that why you came here before?
To pay for your mom's treatment?

693
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,454
So why did you come back?

694
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,500
If I were you,
I would have put everything behind me

695
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,293
and started a new life with the money.

696
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,507
If...

697
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,720
I died right before your eyes,

698
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,182
and you...

699
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,143
won all the money,

700
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,979
how would you feel?

701
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,360
Come on, don't say that.
We'll make it out together.

702
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,445
That's why I came back.

703
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,949
To make it out with everyone.

704
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,118
To end this game.

705
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,122
But

706
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,959
I don't know anymore.

707
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,089
I don't know what more I can do here.

708
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,761
I ruined your plan
by pressing that button.

709
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,638
I told you it's not your fault.

710
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,981
Hey, do you remember
when we went on strike?

711
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,901
We were occupying the factory,
and management told us to come out.

712
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,821
They said anyone who came out voluntarily

713
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,866
would be let off the hook
and receive more severance pay.

714
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,244
How could I forget?

715
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,249
When I was on night watch,
I wanted to go out. Guess why I didn't.

716
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:51,546
You were sleeping beside me,
and you were talking in your sleep.

717
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,758
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

718
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,053
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

719
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:01,848
You were sobbing in your sleep.

720
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,897
- I cried in my sleep?
- Yes.

721
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,024
Asking for food?

722
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:11,983
Yeah.

723
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,693
So you stayed because of me?

724
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:18,197
Yeah. I was watching you, and I thought,

725
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,785
"Man, look at this poor little wuss."

726
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,246
"If he wakes up and sees that I'm gone,

727
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:29,250
he'll start crying and won't even
be able to go the bathroom."

728
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,628
Then I knew I couldn't fucking leave you.

729
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,005
You're so full of shit.

730
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,381
No, I swear on your mom.

731
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,675
Why on my mom? Swear on your own.

732
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,802
Whoever's mom it is, it's true.

733
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,139
I got fired and ended up like this
because I stayed.

734
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:47,060
You always blame me
for every bad thing that happens,

735
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,521
losing money on the horses
and for your failed chicken shop.

736
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,856
What else? Getting married?

737
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,817
No, I got married because I wanted to.
I got divorced because of you.

738
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,570
Hey, I got divorced because of you.

739
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,989
Because you'd always
invite me out for drinks.

740
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,575
And you're the one
who got me into horse racing.

741
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:05,453
All right. Quiet down.

742
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,333
You're finally acting like
the Seong Gi-hun I know.

743
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,005
You've been acting like
a different person.

744
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,261
Gi-hun.

745
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,810
After the next game,
let's get out of here, okay?

746
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,605
Let's go drink soju like old times.

747
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,068
You're buying.

748
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:45,076
People really don't change.

749
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,954
Seong Gi-hun,
the cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong.

750
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,331
The biggest cheapskate.

751
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,084
The king of cheapskates.

752
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,047
"The cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong."
That takes me back.

753
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,527
Is she still in there?

754
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,487
Yes.

755
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,664
Hello? Are you all right?

756
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,086
Are you okay in there? Is something wrong?

757
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,727
Oh, dear. What's wrong?

758
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,731
Are you in pain? Is your belly hurting?

759
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,983
Oh, no. Your baby must be coming.

760
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,944
Listen, tell me where and how it hurts.

761
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,531
I'm scared.

762
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,584
It's okay.

763
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,670
It's okay.

764
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:21,839
It's okay.

765
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,303
Everything is going to be okay.

766
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,351
You and your baby
are going to be all right.

767
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,894
Don't worry.

768
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,819
Team 2, be careful too.

769
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,530
If you find anything suspicious,
contact us right away.

770
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,490
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

771
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,535
Captain Park, be careful out there.

772
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,124
Team 2 will search up north.

773
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,168
We'll head out to the southwest.

774
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,294
Okay.

775
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,421
We have to find it in the next four days.

776
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,339
Don't worry.

777
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:07,677
Captain Ko over there is a local too.
He knows the area inside and out.

778
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,681
And we've got enough fuel
and food for a week.

779
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,808
- Let's give it a go.
- All right.

780
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,434
You've got some soju too, right?

781
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:20,147
I'll catch some fish with this at night.
You can slice it up nicely for us.

782
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:22,525
Hey, do you think
you're on a fishing boat?

783
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:27,446
Stay on your toes
until we find that island.

784
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,660
When it gets dark,
we won't be able to do anything anyway.

785
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,620
What are we supposed to do all night?

786
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,583
Are you going to sing and dance for us?

787
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,132
All right, let's set sail!

788
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,886
The team that finds it first
gets a bonus! Good luck!

789
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,596
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

790
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:02,148
The third game will begin momentarily.

791
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:06,444
All players, please get out of bed
and get ready.

792
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,738
Let me repeat.

793
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,826
The third game will begin momentarily.

794
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:18,039
All players, please get out of bed
and get ready.

795
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,337
Hey, brother. Can I have one too?

796
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,590
You don't want to know.

797
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,842
Once you take it,
you'll never be normal again.

798
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,764
If you get out of here,
don't get involved with them ever again.

799
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,936
Why did you team up with them then?

800
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,980
Because idiots like them
are easier to deal with.

801
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,194
What about me?
Why did you team up with me?

802
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,237
Because...

803
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,699
I thought you wouldn't deceive me.

804
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,326
What?

805
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:02,375
Anyway, I'm getting out
once the prize money reaches 200 million.

806
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,836
I don't know your situation,
but think carefully.

807
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,383
You won't last long in here.

808
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,456
All soldiers,
please proceed to your stations.

809
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,593
- Wow.
- Yeah!

810
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,030
Young-mi.

811
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:18,993
I'm sorry.

812
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,538
It's okay.

813
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:27,418
We can all win the game
and make it out together.

814
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,602
Welcome to your third game.

815
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,397
The game you will be playing is Mingle.

816
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,192
Let me repeat.

817
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,820
The game you will be playing is Mingle.

818
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,907
Hey, we'll be mingling together.

819
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,867
Doesn't that sound like so much fun?

820
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:07,416
All players,
please step onto the center platform.

821
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,503
When the game starts,
the platform will begin to rotate,

822
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,671
and you will hear a number.

823
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:16,300
You must form groups of that size,

824
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,845
go into the rooms,
and close the door within 30 seconds.

825
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:23,265
Oh, this game? We used to play
something similar on school trips.

826
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,809
We formed groups by hugging.

827
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:27,603
Yeah. Instead of hugging,
we go into those rooms.

828
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,355
I know this game.

829
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,317
How should we play this?
Is there a strategy?

830
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,112
If the number is four,
we can stay together.

831
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,614
If it's two, you and me pair up.

832
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:42,451
If the number is bigger than five,
we'll get the additional people we need.

833
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,412
But what if it's smaller than five?

834
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,207
Like three or four.

835
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,543
We'll figure it out as we go.

836
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,587
No matter what happens, don't panic.
Let's stay calm.

837
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:54,839
Let's trust each other.

838
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,882
We'll all make it out together. Here.

839
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:06,892
One, two, three.

840
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,144
- Go!
- Victory at all costs!

841
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,189
Let the game begin.

842
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:26,537
Round and round

843
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:31,000
Let's go around in circles and dance

844
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,462
We will clap our hands and sing

845
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:40,134
La-la-la-la, let's have fun dancing

846
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:49,226
Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a
Ring-a, ring-a-ring

847
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:53,480
We will go hand in hand

848
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,152
And have fun jumping around

849
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,884
