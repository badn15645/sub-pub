We will go hand in hand

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,188

00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,274
Round and round

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,067
Ten.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,111
We need two!

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,113
We need five. Come with us!

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,532
We need four. Come quickly!

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,909
- How many are you?
- Four.

9
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,579
That makes us nine.

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,872
Are you a group of five?

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,874
So are we. Come with us!

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:45,462
Hey! We have five people too!
Come on, come with us!

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,256
We have to hurry!

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,549
There's no time, Gi-hun.

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,092
We need one more!

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,762
We have ten now!

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,222
Room 44! Green door!

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,641
- This way! Hurry!

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,268
Mom, Room 44. Mom!

20
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,228
- Run!
- Go in!

21
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,396
Go in!

22
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,529
Wait! Please spare me!

23
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,414
Don't kill me, please...

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,510
You're alive thanks to me!

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,844
God, she scared me.

26
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,615
So there's a reason you've lived
longer than you were destined to.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,371
There's a reason you were brought here.

28
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,684

Let's go around in circles and dance

La-la-la-la, let's have fun dancing

Ring-a, ring-a, ring-a
Ring-a, ring-a-ring

38
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:16,154
We will go hand in hand

39
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,742
And have fun jumping around

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,577
Round and round

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,621
Four.

42
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,001
Please.

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,337
Gyeong-su, you're out!

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,838
- Gyeong-su.
- Let's go!

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,299
Wait, Gyeong-su...

46
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,641
- You four, go!
- No, you go.

47
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,102
Go ahead, guys. I need three people!

48
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,896
- We have no choice. Let's go!
- Young-il...

49
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,689
Three people! I need three people!

50
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,201
- Do you think Young-il will be okay?
- Ten.

51
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,327
Nine.

52
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,411
Eight.

53
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,329
Seven.

54
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,247
Six.

55
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,164
Five.

56
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,165
- We need two!
- Four.

57
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,083
Three.

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,125
- Gi-hun.
- Two.

59
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,043
One.

60
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,261
Nam-gyu, what happened to Gyeong-su?

61
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,513
Min-su, you fucker.

62
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,017
Talk to me like I'm your friend again,
and I'll leave you out there next time.

63
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,061
Wait!

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,777
Where did you leave my boy Gyeong-su?

65
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,993
Fuck! Gyeong-su!

66
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,670
It's okay. I don't think they noticed.

67
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,011
Room 33, eliminated.

68
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,601
What?

69
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,147
Please. Wait...

70
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,734
Hey, Min-su!

71
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,862
Come on, my boy. Come on!

72
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,277
Brother Young-il!

73
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,362
Young-il?

74
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,864
Gi-hun.

75
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,367
Brother Young-il!

76
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,953
Oh, thank God.

77
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,373
- Whoa.
- I knew you were going to be okay!

78
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,166
I knew it. You're not just anybody.

79
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,378
I was worried. I'm glad you made it.

80
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,632
I'm a likeable guy,
so I'm good at games like this.

81
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,801
Are you feeling all right?

82
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,136
Yes, I'm all right.

83
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,596
I'm glad you're back.

84
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,559
Wait a minute.

85
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,727
If the next number is six,

86
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,938
we won't need anyone else, will we?

87
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,482
Why not?

88
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,652
Oh, in her tummy?

89
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,656
Right, that makes six.

90
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,284
You're right.

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,994
What if it's twins?

92
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,871
Does that make seven?

93
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,380
All players,
please step onto the center platform.

94
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,471
Begin.

95
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,062
Round and round

96
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:04,775
Let's go around in circles and dance

97
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:09,447
We will clap our hands and sing

98
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,364
La-la-la...

99
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,491
Three.

100
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,702
What do we do?

101
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,954
Let's pair up
and find one more person each.

102
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,667
- Who should we take?
- Rock, paper, scissors!

103
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,419
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Come with me.

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,925
Winner comes with us!
Rock, paper, scissors!

105
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,721
Min-su threw scissors!

106
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,015
Min-su, you win!

107
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,559
Come on, my boy!
Min-su is with us. Let's go!

108
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,145
- The three of you, go!
- Yeah, go! Hurry!

109
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,855
- One person!
- We need one person!

110
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,440
We need one person!

111
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,942
- Anyone?
- We need one person!

112
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,902
We need one person here!

113
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,861
Come with us!

114
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,112
We're two people.

115
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,448
Come on! We're going to die!

116
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,741
She's my mom!

117
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,951
For God's sake!

118
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,745
Mom!

119
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,888
Run!

120
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,519
The following players
have been eliminated.

121
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,942
Players 034, 038, 104, 109,

122
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:34,574
291, 309, 335,

123
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,577
345, 347...

124
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,161
Are you all right?

125
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,543
Oh, yes. Thank you.

126
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,963
You gentlemen saved my life.

127
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,172
Where's your son?

128
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,676
Sorry?

129
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,177
Weren't you with him?

130
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:02,101
Oh, well, I lost hold of him.

131
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:07,023
He told me to wait
until he brought one more person,

132
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,483
but I lost him in all the fuss.

133
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,193
He didn't come back?

134
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,372
My son isn't that kind of person.

135
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,752
We may be poor, but he has a good heart.

136
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,713
He'd rather be bullied
than bully another human being.

137
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,049
He's never hurt a soul!

138
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,259
Watch what you say!

139
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,472
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

140
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,818
Welcome back, my friends.

141
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,903
Skrrt!

142
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,384
Mrs. Jang!

143
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,763
Goodness! I'm so glad you're okay.

144
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,100
You're not hurt at all, are you?

145
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,811
He saved our lives.

146
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,565
Mr. 246 here showed up
when we were running out of time,

147
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,192
just like Prince Charming!

148
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,530
Boy, you do look like a prince.
Thank you so much.

149
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,367
Not at all. These two saved my life.

150
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,868
Where's Yong-sik?

151
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:44,870
Mom.

152
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,844
It's okay. I made it.

153
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,763
You're not hurt, are you?

154
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,974
Mom.

155
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,727
I...

156
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,896
I'm so...

157
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,442
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

158
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,486
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

159
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,071
We both made it.

160
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,989
I'm so sorry.

161
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,075
Don't be. We both made it.
That's all that matters.

162
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,955
Mom!

163
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:48,184
Round and round

164
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,396
Let's go around in circles and dance

165
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,315
Six.

166
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,776
Four women and two men, go!

167
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,861
- Which two men?
- I'm going with my mom!

168
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
I... I'll go.

169
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,072
Six! Go!

170
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,116
All right, we need two people!

171
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,075
Over there!

172
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,333
- What? Get out of here!
- Get out!

173
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,711
Over here! This room is empty! Hurry!

174
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,796
Ten.

175
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,887
Seven.

176
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,305
Six.

177
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,389
- Where's Young-mi?
- Unnie!

178
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,349
Four.

179
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,266
Three.

180
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,184
Young-mi!

181
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,352
Two.

182
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,269
One.

183
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,359
Unnie.

184
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:45,199
Young-mi!

185
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,453
Young-mi...

186
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,790
No.

187
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,710
No! Young-mi!

188
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,004
- No, Young-mi!
- Young-mi!

189
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,424
Yong-sik, what do we do?

190
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,552
Young-mi! What do we do?

191
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,678
It's your fault.

192
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,889
Don't kid yourself.

193
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,766
If I hadn't come in, you'd be dead too.

194
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:14,395
It's your fault! I could have saved her!

195
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,771
There was no time!

196
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,815
The moment you went out to save her,

197
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
you'd have died
along with everyone else here

198
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,528
for not having enough people!

199
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,739
I saved your lives!

200
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,283
Isn't that right?

201
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,076
Am I wrong?

202
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,078
Say something!

203
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,790
He...

204
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,335
is right about that.

205
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,133
It's true. There wasn't enough time.

206
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,086
Thank you.

207
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,089
Don't get the wrong idea.

208
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,759
What you said was right. That's all.

209
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,954
Now, the final round will begin.

210
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
What do you think it'll be this time?

211
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,047
Two.

212
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,048
Why?

213
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,592
There are 126 people left,

214
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,552
and there are 50 rooms.

215
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,181
So there won't be enough rooms
for everyone, only for 100 people.

216
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,726
The rest will be killed.

217
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,609
Two.

218
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,737
Gi-hun.

219
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,115
Gi-hun, let's go!

220
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,574
Come on!

221
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,611
What the hell? Let go of me!

222
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,987
Get in!

223
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,868
Get out.

224
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,286
We were here first.

225
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,082
Open the door, you bastards!
I was here first!

226
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,708
I'm sorry!

227
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,918
Eight.

228
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,919
Seven.

229
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,836
Six.

230
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,754
Five.

231
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,671
Four.

232
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,672
Three.

233
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,882
Two.

234
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,800
One.

235
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,555
Game over.

236
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,158
When we get back, let's count
the number of people remaining.

237
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,285
Why?

238
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,496
If we count the numbers of Os and Xs,

239
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,667
we'll be able to see
who's likely to win the next vote.

240
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,629
We'll have to hope
more people from the other side died.

241
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,560
By the way,
what's this thing called again?

242
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,187
It's called a drone.

243
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,190
"Drong"? It's so cool.

244
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,860
Up until now, you had to use binoculars,

245
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,487
climb onto the island, and all that shit.

246
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,698
This makes things much easier.

247
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,368
Fly lower. They know we're onto them.
They likely improved their camouflage.

248
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,328
Got it.

249
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,920
But what makes you think
we can find them within a few days

250
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,671
when you couldn't over the last two years?

251
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,882
If we exclude the places
I've already searched,

252
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,343
we can narrow down the search area.

253
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,887
We'll find them if the weather holds up.

254
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,308
That's right. We've got another team
and this "drong" thing now.

255
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,518
Captain. It's "drone," not "drong."

256
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,853
Whatever.

257
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,242
My little boy, Min-su!

258
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,455
I'm so happy to see you again, bro.

259
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,834
Min-su, do you know how worried I was?

260
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
I thought I was running with you.

261
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,424
But then I realized
I was with this douche.

262
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,344
I told you he wouldn't die easily.
You saw what he did.

263
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,056
When Se-mi stuck her hand out like this,
he took a beat, then went scissors.

264
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,142
I thought, "Damn, he's unbelievable."

265
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,936
I got chills, Min-su.

266
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,021
Let's play one more game, okay?

267
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,481
You'll play one more, right?

268
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,822
What did you want to tell me?
Make it quick.

269
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,907
Jun-hee.

270
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,244
When we get out, let's start over.

271
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,246
"Start over"?

272
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
How exactly?

273
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,250
Trust me one last time.

274
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,462
We can have our baby and start over.

275
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,968
I did some calculations.

276
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,387
Each person will get 300 to 400 million.

277
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,764
A lot of people will want to leave.

278
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,850
We could win the next vote.

279
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,477
If we get out,

280
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
then what?

281
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,900
If we put our money together,
it'll be a lot.

282
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,028
We'll pay off some urgent debts first.

283
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,572
I'll find a new way of investing
the rest of the money.

284
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,659
No more coin.

285
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,912
I know a team of great stockbrokers.

286
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,749
They deal in inverse ETFs
and futures trading.

287
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,543
Their profit rate was
over 100% last month.

288
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,171
It's my money you need, isn't it?

289
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,548
Not me and the baby.

290
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,550
It's not like that, Jun-hee.

291
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,928
I want to make enough money
to build a good life for us--

292
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,888
"Enough money"?

293
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,640
How much is that exactly?

294
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,683
What?

295
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,605
Pay your debts with your own money.

296
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,858
I'm going to use mine to raise my baby.

297
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,571
Jun-hee.

298
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,742
- Listen to me.
- Min-su, Nam-su, Gyeong-su, so many "su"s

299
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,745
Hey, look at those two.

300
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,707
What's going on?

301
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,833
Maybe they're a thing.

302
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,711
That bastard sure is lucky.

303
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,129
Even in a place like this.

304
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,136
Don't be so sad.

305
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,600
You will be joining her
in the underworld soon.

306
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,897
I've put a curse on you all.

307
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,861
I've been praying to the gods
of heaven and earth with all my heart

308
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,407
to let me see all of you

309
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,035
die in this place, one by one!

310
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,623
You'll never get out of here alive.

311
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,544
You will die a miserable, painful death,

312
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,589
staring at each other the whole time.

313
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:04,359
That woman is not a shaman,
she's just a lunatic.

314
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,360
Good grief.

315
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,574
You should spit too.

316
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,829
Gi-hun, there are 55 people
who voted in favor of continuing.

317
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,038
Are you sure?

318
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,331
I counted them twice.

319
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,667
What about you? Did you include yourself?

320
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,004
It's 56.

321
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,426
We have 44 people on our side,
so we're outnumbered by 12.

322
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,053
Shoot, that means
we're likely to lose again.

323
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,598
It may seem like a big difference,

324
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,768
but if six of them change their minds,
it'll be 50/50, all tied.

325
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,189
If seven of them change their minds,
we could win.

326
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,901
But those who pressed X
might change their minds too.

327
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,696
They probably won't
change their minds easily.

328
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,780
Why not?

329
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,076
They wanted to quit
even when the prize was smaller.

330
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,079
Now they can leave with even more money.

331
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,833
They wouldn't want to risk their lives
playing another game.

332
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,793
I'm going to press X this time.

333
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,713
That means we'll have a tie
if five others change their minds.

334
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,089
With six more, we win.

335
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,928
Then let's go over there
and try to convince them.

336
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,054
No, that's too risky.

337
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,683
Most of them will want
to continue the games.

338
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,145
If we make a move,
they won't just sit back and watch.

339
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,064
So you think we should just stand here

340
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,651
and pray they change their minds?

341
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,612
What if we lose again?

342
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,657
We march down, hand in hand,
to play another game?

343
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,617
I understand how you feel.

344
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,703
I also wish I could leave right now.

345
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,123
But this is the moment to stay calm.

346
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,334
"Stay calm"?

347
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,003
We've already taken a vote twice.

348
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,589
If we can't convince them,

349
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,300
we'll have to bring them over
to our side by force.

350
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,553
If we provoke them now,

351
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,556
we may end up in a big fight
before we even get to vote.

352
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,307
Is that what you want, Gi-hun?

353
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,064
Look, Gi-hun.

354
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,150
I'm too scared to play another game.

355
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,279
I'm sure there are more people like me.

356
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,365
That's right. That's what I think too.

357
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,119
If it's just five or six people,
we've got a shot.

358
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,539
I did the math, and the prize is
now over 300 million per person.

359
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,333
I think that gives us
a pretty good chance.

360
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:41,933
Congratulations to all of you
for making it through the third game.

361
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,646
Now, here are the results
of the third game.

362
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,075
Hang on. Can you double back?

363
00:26:59,075 --> 00:26:59,993
Sure.

364
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,291
There's something on the ground.

365
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,209
What's that? A door?

366
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,419
Get down lower.

367
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,298
I can't because of the trees.

368
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,841
We've got to go check it out.

369
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,803
Everyone, get ready to move!

370
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,765
It's 356 million won.

371
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:26,061
With that kind of money,
some of them will change their minds.

372
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,482
If we get six more people, it's a tie.
If it's seven, we win.

373
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,861
The vote will once again be conducted
in reverse order of your player numbers.

374
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,114
Player 456, please cast your vote.

375
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,078
To ensure fair and democratic voting,

376
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,832
we will not tolerate
any disruptions from this point onward.

377
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,210
Please bear that in mind.

378
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,114
Player 388.

379
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,411
Six more to win.

380
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,419
Player 380.

381
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,465
Five more.

382
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,101
- Player 377.
- That fucking bitch.

383
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,982
Number 011.

384
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:59,404
If you'd done this sooner, you wouldn't
have gotten a scratch on your pretty face.

385
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,573
Let's keep it this way.

386
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,514
Player 230.

387
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,819
Circle! Let's go!

388
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,338
It's four people now.
Four more, and we win.

389
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,798
Player 149.

390
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,595
If you pull the same crap again,
I'll hang myself right here.

391
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,679
I got it.

392
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,438
Player 145.

393
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,446
Min-su. Just one more game.

394
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,990
I already talked to him.

395
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,577
We agreed to play one more game
and leave with one billion.

396
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,289
Player 125.

397
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,918
Come on, Min-su. Come on.

398
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,775
With three more people, we win.

399
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,365
Player 124.

400
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,587
Player 120.

401
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,685
Only two more now!

402
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,103
Player 119.

403
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,647
Two more. We need two more people.

404
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,465
I think it leads underground.

405
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,549
Open it.

406
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,067
Player 015.

407
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,459
He switched to X!

408
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,753
That's six! It's a tie now.

409
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,213
If we get one more person, we win.

410
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,925
Are we really going home?

411
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,844
Player 009.

412
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,861
It's all right. She voted O before anyway.

413
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,487
Player 007.

414
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,415
Your son will definitely vote X
this time, right?

415
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:07,754
Don't worry. My Yong-sik
will definitely press X this time.

416
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,341
He switched sides! That's it!

417
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,760
Yes!

418
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,180
Let's go home!

419
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,098
- Yes! Let's go home!
- Yes!

420
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,435
- Player 006.
- He was the seventh one.

421
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,235
We did it. They're both on our side.
We're going to win!

422
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,747
Gi-hun.

423
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,415
Yeah?

424
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,501
About Young-il...

425
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,046
What about him?

426
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,467
Well, when I was
in the room with him earlier...

427
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,820
Good job.

428
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,447
- Well done! That's great!
- Yes!

429
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,993
Lastly, Player 001.

430
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,912
Please cast your vote.

431
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,753
Brother Young-il.

432
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,880
Let's go!

433
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,802
It's going to be 50/50,
so it's still a tie, isn't it?

434
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,401
Young-il scares me a little.

435
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
What do you mean?

436
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,285
I don't know how to put this,

437
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,788
but when I was in the room with him
in the last game...

438
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,000
he...

439
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,212
That's it! Finally.

440
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,382
Oh, my God.

441
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,092
We did it.

442
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,599
We did it.

443
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,100
It's a tie.

444
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,478
The vote has ended.

445
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,733
Wait, it's a tie. What happens now?

446
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,068
Clause three of the consent form.

447
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:40,448
"In the case of a tie,
players will vote again."

448
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,368
So when are we going to vote again?

449
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,205
To give you some time to think,

450
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,041
the vote will be conducted tomorrow.

451
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,962
Until then, please think carefully
about your future.

452
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,119
Listen. Maybe we should head back to port.

453
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,914
Isn't it all over
if we don't find it in the next few days?

454
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,085
That's true,
but you should take him to the hospital.

455
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,004
How are you holding up?
Can you push through?

456
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,382
Yes, I'm okay.

457
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,052
His bleeding has stopped,
and I stitched him up. He'll be fine.

458
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,429
Still, someone just died.

459
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,806
Let's keep going.

460
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,141
He won't be able to rest in peace

461
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,185
until we even the score
with those bastards.

462
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,689
But they've even set up booby traps.

463
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,066
That means they already know
our whereabouts.

464
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,238
From now on, a different radio channel
will be used each day,

465
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,323
and cell phone usage is prohibited.

466
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,950
You heard him.

467
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,118
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,161
Please let Team 2 know.

469
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,761
- What were you going to tell me earlier?
- What?

470
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,308
About Young-il during the last game.

471
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,820
I guess it's not him. It's this place
that's making everyone crazy.

472
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,656
We have to get out of here.

473
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,825
I might go crazy too if I stay any longer.

474
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,876
You know, Young-il.

475
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,212
I thought you might vote in favor,
like on day one.

476
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,591
I was so nervous, I couldn't watch.

477
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,218
Jung-bae also said something weird--

478
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,887
Just eat.

479
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,972
Aren't you hungry?

480
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,769
Thank you, Young-il.
You gave us another chance.

481
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,480
No, I just wanted to stay alive.

482
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:24,487
The money is enough now too,
so I should get out of here.

483
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,614
Alive.

484
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:33,913
But do you think
we'll be able to win the second vote?

485
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,665
We'll have to go for broke.

486
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,086
Like Gi-hun said earlier,

487
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:45,216
we should try to convince some of them
to change their minds

488
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,967
before the second vote.

489
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,969
Will they though?

490
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,848
They seem to have
lost their minds over the money.

491
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,017
The way I see it,
we're more likely to win.

492
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,062
All we've got to eat
is this roll of gimbap.

493
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,606
Everyone will be so hungry tomorrow.

494
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:05,111
When you're hungry,
you start to miss home.

495
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,697
Hey!

496
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,119
Don't agonize over your decision
while eating this dry gimbap.

497
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,205
I just want one of you
to come over to our side.

498
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,875
If we get out of here tomorrow morning,

499
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,877
we could get Korean beef!

500
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,214
I'll tell you what. It's my treat!

501
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,258
And after that, the noodles are on me!

502
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,260
Come over to our side! Anyone!

503
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,803
Come on over!

504
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,889
Once you all die in the next game,

505
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,268
we can all leave with 800 million each!

506
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,314
With 800 million,
we could buy a freaking cattle ranch!

507
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,233
- That's right!
- You can join us!

508
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,445
- That's right! Come on over!
- Come over to our side!

509
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,697
You'll get 800 million?
Who are you kidding?

510
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,491
Do you think you'll still be alive
after the next game?

511
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,327
If you don't get out now,
you're all going to die!

512
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:59,915
So let's play one more game
to see who dies.

513
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,460
Stop trying to run away
like a goddamn coward.

514
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,839
What did you say? Hey, come here.

515
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,299
Come here, asshole!

516
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,925
- Let's go.
- I'll take you down, chump!

517
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,010
Not with civilians.

518
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,969
Come here.

519
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,182
I was in the Marines, fucking asshole!

520
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:22,271
Oh, yeah?
Then I was in the air force, fucker!

521
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:26,525
Hey, if you want to go home,
why would you even bother eating?

522
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,402
Just starve!

523
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,653
That's it.

524
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,825
- Come on, fuckers!
- You fucker!

525
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,894
Min-su.

526
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,313
I know you're upset with me.

527
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,565
I'm sorry, boy!

528
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,529
But still, you shouldn't have betrayed me.
That really hurt.

529
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,114
- Open the door.
- Hey, Min-su.

530
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:17,910
You said you got scammed in a rental deal
and have no place to go anyway.

531
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,453
Open the door!

532
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,829
Let's play one more game.

533
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,041
We'll protect you. I swear.

534
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,461
So when we vote again tomorrow,
press O, all right? Come here.

535
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,131
Whoa, boy. Sit the fuck down.

536
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,509
Look, Min-su.

537
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,639
Before I came here,
I went to a bridge to kill myself.

538
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,933
But on that bridge,

539
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,728
a man in a suit came
and gave me that card.

540
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,064
You got one too, didn't you?

541
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,524
Yes.

542
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,361
I don't have a religion, but it felt like...

543
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,490
like divine intervention.

544
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,369
It felt like I was being given
a chance at a whole new life.

545
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,289
So I decided to give it my best shot

546
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,291
and make my mom proud.

547
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,501
But you're stopping me from doing that.

548
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,004
It makes me fucking furious!

549
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,131
I'm so fucking angry, man!

550
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,215
Knock it off.

551
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,933
Mind your own damn business and fuck off.

552
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,602
You're interfering with the vote.

553
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,272
The amazing Myung-gi.
Who do you think you are?

554
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,024
The election commissioner?

555
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,066
MG Coin.

556
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:36,572
You're next,
so just take a piss and get out.

557
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,662
Everyone on Team X!
These guys are threatening one of us!

558
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,415
They're forcing him to vote O next time!

559
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:50,336
Is that true? Hey, that's cheating.

560
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,380
You kids are still so young.

561
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,674
Who taught you to do something so nasty?

562
00:43:55,674 --> 00:44:00,679
Hey! Team O!

563
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,098
These Xs are about to attack us!

564
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,143
What the fuck? Why would they attack us?

565
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,354
Shut your trap.

566
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,608
You damn wimps.
Just shut up and take a piss!

567
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,276
I already did, asshole.

568
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,154
Min-su, come here.

569
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,616
MG Coin.

570
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,035
Are you high?

571
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,038
Have you lost your mind?

572
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,459
It's because of her, isn't it?
We saw him with some bitch earlier.

573
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,504
It looked like they were a thing, remember?

574
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,342
You little shit. You have time
to fool around with a girl?

575
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,553
I've been watching her carefully.

576
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,683
She was walking a bit funny,
and her belly looked--

577
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,185
Leave her alone, you bastards!

578
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,107
You're getting all worked up.
So there is something going on.

579
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,316
I'm telling you.

580
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,402
MG Coin.

581
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,489
- Something's going on.
- If you press X again tomorrow,

582
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:05,077
I'm going to cut off your finger,
give it to her,

583
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,287
and ask her out.

584
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,499
She'll love it.

585
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,418
You asshole!

586
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,507
You motherfucker!

587
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,635
I'll end you!

588
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:42,156
Your money, your girl, your life,
they're all mine.

589
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,200
It all belongs to me, Thanos the great!

590
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:53,208
You fucking... You son of a fucking bitch!

591
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,455
