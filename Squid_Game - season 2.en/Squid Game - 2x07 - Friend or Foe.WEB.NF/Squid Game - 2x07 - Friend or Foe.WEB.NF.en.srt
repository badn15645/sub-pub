You motherfucker!

Fuck!

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,948
Motherfucker! Fucking X bastard!

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,450
Damn you!

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,664
Fuck you! You fucking loser!

6
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,792

- Fucking asshole! Die!

EPISODE 7
FRIEND OR FOE

9
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,933
<i>The following players
have been eliminated.</i>

10
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>Players 230, 268,</i>

11
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>299, 331, and 401.</i>

12
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,570
<i>End of list.</i>

13
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,855
What's going on?

14
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,245
Listen, Team O!

15
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,872
We...

16
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,291
When we were in the bathroom,

17
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:33,213
those fucking X bastards
tried to kill all of us!

18
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,049
They killed some of us,
including my friend--

19
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,051
Bullshit.

20
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,386
You're the ones who started it.

21
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,554
Damn it.

22
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,767
They threatened one of the people
on our side!

23
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,436
They attacked us to win the second vote!

24
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,354
That's right!

25
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,271
Hey.

26
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,274
You killed one of us first.

27
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,111
You were trying to win the vote
by killing us!

28
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,948
Fuck you. You killed some of us too.

29
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,909
Did you think we would
just let you kill the rest of us?

30
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,453
So?

31
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,706
Which side lost more people?

32
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,336
What?

33
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,258
All right, everyone!
Let's count the numbers!

34
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,886
Yeah, that's right!
Let's count ourselves! Come on down!

35
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,265
Everyone! Gather round!

36
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,559
We need everyone down here! Come on!

37
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,271
- Get down here now!
- Gather round!

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,647
- Come on!
- Get down here!

39
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,650
- Gather round!
- Form a line!

40
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,737
- Please come down!
- Form a line!

41
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,072
- Captain?
- Huh?

42
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,784
What are you doing here?

43
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,537
Oh, well...

44
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,915
Isn't that my drone?

45
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,210
What? Oh, this?

46
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,714
Well, I was looking for something
because I couldn't sleep,

47
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,549
and I just stumbled across it.

48
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,471
Did you do something?

49
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
No, I was just looking.

50
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,811
I'm fascinated by
how this thing can fly in the sky.

51
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,398
All right. I'm done now.

52
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,816
It's so fascinating.

53
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,070
You reek of alcohol.

54
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,988
Go get some sleep now, okay?

55
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,077
Stop!

56
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,080
Who are you really?

57
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,957
You son of a bitch!

58
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,141
Who's there?

59
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,855
Choi, is that you?

60
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,690
It's me, Captain Park.

61
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,571
Captain, I thought you were asleep.
What are you doing out here?

62
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,948
It's pouring down.

63
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,784
I couldn't sleep.
I was tossing and turning,

64
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,577
then I heard some noise.

65
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,162
I heard it too.

66
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,873
I think I heard someone scream
and some thuds after that.

67
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,418
That's why I came out to take a look.

68
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,797
I think it was the waves hitting the deck.

69
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,215
Look at the mess.

70
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,468
Oh, you're right.

71
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,765
It's dangerous out here in the rain.
Go back inside and get some sleep.

72
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,310
The boat's rocking so much.
I can't really sleep.

73
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,440
Still, you've got to wake up early.
Try to get some sleep.

74
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,484
Or you'll be exhausted tomorrow.

75
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,462
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

76
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,547
46,

77
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,549
47.

78
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,888
Three dead.

79
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,764
Are you sure?

80
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,099
I counted three times.

81
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,309
What about them?

82
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,858
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

83
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,153
Two people died on our side.

84
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,866
Two out of five.
That means they lost three people.

85
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,913
Then we have a better shot
at winning the vote tomorrow.

86
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,376
Hey, it's 48 against 47.

87
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,379
As long as we don't change our minds,
we'll win by one vote!

88
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,631
Yes!

89
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,217
- We'll win.
- We can get out of here tomorrow.

90
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:37,308
<i>Attention, please.
Lights out in 30 minutes.</i>

91
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,771
<i>All players, please return to your beds
and prepare for bedtime.</i>

92
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,731
Listen. You cannot change your minds.

93
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,277
We have to win the second vote
and get out of here tomorrow. All right?

94
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,197
Don't worry. We're determined to get out.

95
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,325
That's right.
We really have to get out now.

96
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,952
Yes, let's do this.

97
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,622
All right.
Let's go to sleep now, shall we?

98
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,863
The delivery team has set out.

99
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,782
How are the goods?

100
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>In top condition this time.</i>

101
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,413
And Number 011?

102
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,708
That bitch is behaving.
Won't be a problem anymore.

103
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,668
Keep watching her carefully.

104
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,378
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

105
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,890
Get ready.

106
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

107
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,237
<i>Managers, soldiers, and workers,</i>

108
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,033
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

109
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,369
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

110
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

111
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,169
<i>Managers, soldiers, and workers,</i>

112
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

113
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,352
<i>Lights out in 20 minutes.</i>

114
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,273
<i>All players, please prepare for bedtime.</i>

115
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,446
Those bastards are acting suspicious.

116
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,782
It looks like they're up to something.

117
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,202
Whatever those idiots do,
once we win the vote tomorrow,

118
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,870
it'll all be over.

119
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,163
You think we'll be okay?

120
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,376
They say things were really crazy
in the bathroom earlier.

121
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Once the lights go out,

122
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,050
people on the other side will attack us.

123
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,260
Really?

124
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,683
Because if they kill us, they'll be able
to win the vote and increase the prize.

125
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,185
So what do we do?

126
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,646
Let's attack them first.

127
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,779
They're probably thinking
we'll just wait for the second vote.

128
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,782
We can use it to our advantage.

129
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,159
We'll attack them first
once the lights go out.

130
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,162
That's right.
It'd be better to attack them first.

131
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,581
We have more women
and elderly on our side.

132
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,042
If we get attacked,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

133
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,422
Attacking them first
would give us a better chance of winning.

134
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,674
- I agree.
- We can't do that.

135
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,178
But we have to get out of here.

136
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,306
You said it yourself.

137
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,309
Staying calm won't get us anywhere now.

138
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,688
That doesn't mean
we should kill each other.

139
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,191
That's exactly what they want us to do.

140
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,485
"They"?

141
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,283
The ones who created this game.

142
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,745
The ones who watch us play.

143
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,541
If we're going to fight someone,
it should be them.

144
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,881
Where are they?

145
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,262
Up there.

146
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,477
On the upper levels

147
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,563
are the rooms they control the games from.

148
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,941
The man in the black mask is their leader.

149
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,696
Once we capture him, we'll be able to win.

150
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
How are you going to fight them?

151
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,372
They have guns.

152
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,007
<i>All armed soldiers,
please move to your designated locations.</i>

153
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,887
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

154
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
We'll fight them with guns too.

155
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,268
But we don't have any.

156
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,313
We'll take their guns.

157
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,529
From those masked men?

158
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,450
That's too dangerous.

159
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,163
Even if we manage to take a few guns,
we'll still be outnumbered.

160
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,623
What then?

161
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,962
Are you going to kill each other all night
and hope you survive?

162
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,259
Is that what you want, Young-il?

163
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,139
Do we...

164
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,725
stand a chance?

165
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,061
We do if we catch them off guard.

166
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,772
Out of everyone,

167
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,317
they're the ones
who would least expect us to attack first.

168
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,319
This is

169
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,617
our last chance
to end these games once and for all.

170
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,747
How are you going to take their guns?

171
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,963
Once the fight begins tonight,

172
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,967
we'll have our chance.

173
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,394
<i>Lights out in five minutes.</i>

174
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,454
Thanos, that fucking asshole.

175
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,999
That son of a bitch
treated me like a fucking idiot.

176
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,370
Myung-gi.

177
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,917
When the lights go out, hide.

178
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,380
No matter what happens, don't do anything.

179
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,509
Okay.

180
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,680
And wipe that blood off.

181
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>Lights out in ten seconds.</i>

182
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,235
<i>Ten,</i>

183
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>nine,</i>

184
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,320
<i>eight,</i>

185
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>seven,</i>

186
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,364
<i>six,</i>

187
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,323
<i>five,</i>

188
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
<i>four,</i>

189
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,325
<i>three,</i>

190
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,326
<i>two,</i>

191
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>one.</i>

192
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,516
<i>Once the lights go out,</i>

193
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,853
<i>get under the bottom beds quietly.</i>

194
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>You must not get caught
by those planning to attack us.</i>

195
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,044
Shut up!

196
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,005
Die!

197
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,228
We have to hide until the fight ends.

198
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,731
Don't get caught up in the fight.

199
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,820
But that would put people on our side
at quite a disadvantage.

200
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,158
Without us in the fight,
they'll be outnumbered.

201
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,076
I know.

202
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,288
But if we fight with them

203
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,625
and some of us end up dead or injured,

204
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,836
it will ruin our entire plan.

205
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,341
We can't beat those bastards
with a lower headcount.

206
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,968
Are you suggesting that

207
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,805
we make a small sacrifice
for the greater good?

208
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,353
If we miss this opportunity,

209
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
the sacrifice will be even greater.

210
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
Even if it takes a sacrifice...

211
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,283
we must put an end to this game now.

212
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,832
In that case,

213
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm with you.

214
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,894
<i>The fight won't last long.</i>

215
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,647
<i>Because if all of us end up hurt or dead,</i>

216
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,734
<i>there can't be a next game,
and they wouldn't want that.</i>

217
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,885
Se-mi.

218
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,554
You fucking bitch.

219
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,811
Fuck!

220
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,274
You goddamn bastard!

221
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,570
You fucking bitch!

222
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,617
You think you're better than me?

223
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,931
Suppress!

224
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,307
<i>Prepare.</i>

225
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,184
<i>Suppress.</i>

226
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,770
<i>Once the lights come on,</i>

227
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,858
<i>the soldiers will come
to settle the situation.</i>

228
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,111
Hands up. Get back.

229
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>They'll try to break up the fight first.</i>

230
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,197
Drop your weapon. Hands up.

231
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,075
<i>They won't pay attention to the dead.</i>

232
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,789
<i>- They will scan our trackers...</i>
- Check the IDs of the dead.

233
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>...to identify us.</i>

234
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,633
<i>That'll be our window.</i>

235
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,637
Dae-ho!

236
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,122
Have everyone retreat and close the gate.

237
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,543
<i>Retreat.</i>

238
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,479
Stop! Hold fire!

239
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,190
Everyone, hold fire!

240
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,110
Hands above your head!

241
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,405
On your knees!

242
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,200
You goddamn bastards!

243
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,202
No!

244
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,748
Move! Do you not see this?

245
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,126
They are not human.

246
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,795
They're like goddamn vermin
blinded by money!

247
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,884
This is not what we took these guns for.

248
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,556
If we do this, we'll be no different
from those masked men.

249
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,861
Everyone!

250
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,947
Don't be scared.

251
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,074
Gather round, please!

252
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,909
It's okay to come out.

253
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,871
We're not trying to hurt you!

254
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,001
- Get the guns and ammo from the dead.
- Come on! I have something to say!

255
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,344
Gather all soldiers.

256
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:38,685
<i>All soldiers, please move
to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

257
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,979
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

258
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:46,610
<i>All soldiers, please move
to the assembly point with your weapons.</i>

259
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,257
Everyone.

260
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,885
We will now

261
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:17,474
head up to the masked men's headquarters.

262
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,311
We'll capture the ones who captured us,

263
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,063
put an end to this game,

264
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,565
and make them pay.

265
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,779
Anyone who knows how to use a gun

266
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,742
and wishes to join us,
please step forward.

267
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,514
Hey.

268
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
I know you're scared.

269
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,396
I'm scared too.

270
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,690
But this may be

271
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,069
our last chance
to make it out of this place alive.

272
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,947
Fight with us

273
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,575
so we can go home together.

274
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,077
All together.

275
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,375
I'll fight with you.

276
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,085
Come on.

277
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,046
I'll join you too.

278
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,006
Come join us.

279
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,210
Please check your guns and ammo.

280
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,213
Let's take one radio each.

281
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,425
We'll use channel 7, the lucky number.

282
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,391
Thank you for earlier.

283
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,899
You can buy me a soju when we get out.

284
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
Attention.

285
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,748
This is the MP5, a submachine gun.

286
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,919
First, if you press this lever
in the middle and pull the magazine,

287
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,837
it comes off like this.

288
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,591
If the selector switch is down,
it's set to full auto mode.

289
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,259
Up is single-fire mode.

290
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,306
We don't have many magazines,
so set it to single-fire mode.

291
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,767
Lastly, insert the magazine,

292
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,436
pull the handle, and then release it.

293
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,439
That's how you load it. Are we clear?

294
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,941
- Yes.
- Yes.

295
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,655
How do you know so much about guns?

296
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,661
I was a sergeant first class
in the ROK Special Forces.

297
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,209
Take it off.

298
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,514
Take that off too.

299
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,647
Good God.

300
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,359
Do your parents know
what you're doing here?

301
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,701
Take us to your captain.

302
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,710
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

303
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,631
<i>Please return to your quarters
immediately.</i>

304
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,177
<i>Otherwise,
you will be eliminated from the game.</i>

305
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,387
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

306
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,641
<i>All players, it is bedtime...</i>

307
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,144
I think I'll be hearing this voice
in my dreams. Don't you?

308
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,439
<i>Please return to your quarters
immediately. Otherwise...</i>

309
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,984
Get down!

310
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,455
One o'clock!

311
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,708
Cover me!

312
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,168
Cover!

313
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,369
Hold fire!

314
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,829
Hold fire!

315
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,753
Is everyone okay?

316
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,505
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm okay!

317
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,841
All right, then. Let's go up!

318
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,863
Do not let them get close
to the management area.

319
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,683
How much farther?

320
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,980
Is this the right way?

321
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,653
The entrance to the management area
is around that corner.

322
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,530
The control room is right above it.

323
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
Move it, then.

324
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,992
Wait.

325
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,870
What are you doing?

326
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,830
I need my mask to pass security.

327
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,421
I'll go look for the management area!

328
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,631
Will you be able to find it?
Should I come?

329
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,508
I'll go with Jung-bae.

330
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,885
I need you to buy us some time!

331
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,722
Jung-bae, let's go.

332
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,185
Wait up!

333
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,001
Here!

334
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,631
Don't waste your ammo like that!
You'll quickly run out!

335
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,533
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

336
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,930
Why did you have to bring me
instead of Young-il?

337
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,766
Because you're my friend.

338
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,019
You only say that when you're in a jam.

339
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,231
We're in the management area.

340
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,566
<i>We'll make our way up.</i>

341
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,521
They have magazines in their pockets.

342
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,787
Which way should we go?

343
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,667
The way they came.

344
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,180
Guard the stairs to the control room!

345
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,694
This isn't getting us anywhere!
Let's follow them to the upper level!

346
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,950
We might get surrounded
if we move together without a plan!

347
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,829
Let's wait until
they find the control room!

348
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,829
Everyone! Check your magazines!

349
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,707
I'm down to half.

350
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,834
I've got less than half.

351
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,377
Same!

352
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,920
I've got two-thirds left.

353
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,213
I'm almost out!

354
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,424
Mine is empty!

355
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,136
I'm almost out too!

356
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,224
<i>Young-il, Dae-ho. Can you hear me?</i>

357
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,727
Go ahead!

358
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,895
I think we're right below
the control room!

359
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,024
But we need backup and more ammo.

360
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,443
We're running out of ammo too!

361
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:44,071
There should be spare magazines
in the soldiers' pockets in our quarters.

362
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,614
Go get them!

363
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,699
Got it!

364
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,078
Did you hear that? They need backup!

365
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,540
Three of us will go,
and the rest will stay!

366
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,168
Join us once you get the magazines!

367
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,377
Who wants to go with me?

368
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,462
I'll go!

369
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,379
Me too!

370
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,380
Let's go!

371
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,304
I'll go get the magazines!

372
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,682
I'll come back as soon as I can,
so just hold on until then!

373
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,975
Hyun-ju!

374
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,019
I'll go!

375
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,362
I... I'm out of ammo.

376
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,905
Do you know the way?

377
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,281
Yes.

378
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,743
We destroyed the cameras on the way.
Follow them.

379
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,744
Okay.

380
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,248
Take this. You might run into
the masked men on the way.

381
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,792
Thank you.

382
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,752
I'll cover you. Go!

383
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,462
Cover him!

384
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:11,367
Magazines in pockets.

385
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,205
<i>Dae-ho.</i>

386
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,333
<i>Can you hear me?
Where are those magazines?</i>

387
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,546
Yes, brother. I'm on my way to get them.

388
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,548
All right, Dae-ho! We're counting on you!

389
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,802
Yes, you can count on me, brother!
I'll be there soon!

390
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,394
Jung-bae, cover me.

391
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,645
What are you going to do?

392
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,688
Get their magazines.

393
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,314
No, that's too dangerous.

394
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,191
I'm almost out of ammo.

395
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,277
If they notice, they'll close in on us.

396
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,738
We need more magazines
to hold out until Dae-ho gets here.

397
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,216
Gi-hun, hurry up!

398
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,016
Hurry up and get back here!

399
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:14,532
Magazines...

400
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,244
Magazines in pockets.

401
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:26,877
What's up with him?

402
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,171
I'm not sure.

403
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
Dae-ho, what happened?

404
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,266
Why are you back by yourself?

405
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,267
Magazines.

406
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:46,021
Get the magazines
from those bastards' pockets. Hurry!

407
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,314
Oh, okay.

408
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,068
Are you all right?

409
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,196
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

410
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,241
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

411
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,451
Don't worry. I'll be sure to outlive you.

412
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,873
Gi-hun! Did you find the control room?

413
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,710
I think it's right up there,
but we can't go this way.

414
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,712
I want you to find another way.

415
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,006
I did a quick scan of the layout here.

416
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,091
I'm sure there's a way to go around them.

417
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,094
I want you guys
to keep their focus on you.

418
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,470
We'll hit them from behind.

419
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,471
Okay.

420
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,889
Wait.

421
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,726
Here, take this.

422
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,269
You're going to need it.

423
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:27,730
Are you sure?

424
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,650
Dae-ho will be back with more.

425
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,416
This was all we could find.

426
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,628
Damn it, what's taking him so long?

427
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,215
Do you think he got lost?

428
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,508
Dae-ho, can you hear me?

429
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,219
Where are you? Can you hear me?

430
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,931
<i>Did you find the magazines?
Are you on your way?</i>

431
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,767
<i>Dae-ho, answer me.</i>

432
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,690
<i>Dae-ho, are you there?</i>

433
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,361
<i>Dae-ho, please answer me!</i>

434
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,114
Dae-ho! Answer me!

435
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,617
We can't hold out much longer.
We need those magazines now.

436
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,203
Something must've happened.
I'll go down and check.

437
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:07,913
Please do.

438
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,416
Cover me!

439
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,197
Gi-hun, we found it.

440
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,992
<i>Start attacking and draw their attention.</i>

441
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,618
Then we'll hit them from behind.

442
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,370
Okay, got it!

443
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,188
<i>Young-il, what's going on?
Are you attacking?</i>

444
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,323
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

445
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,909
<i>It's all over.</i>

446
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,787
<i>They got us too.</i>

447
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,959
Young-il, what happened?
Are you all right?

448
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,426
<i>Young-il.</i>

449
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,596
<i>Young-il! Answer me!</i>

450
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,683
<i>Young-il!</i>

451
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,898
Young-il!

452
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,442
Young-il!

453
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,908
Start wrapping things up.

454
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,716
Dae-ho!

455
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,968
Dae-ho, where are you? Dae-ho!

456
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,058
Dae-ho!

457
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,314
Dae-ho.

458
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,774
What happened?

459
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,028
I'm sorry.

460
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,446
The magazines?

461
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,909
I'm sorry.

462
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,827
I'm...

463
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,874
I'm sorry.

464
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,045
I'm sorry.

465
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,718
Get down on the floor!

466
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,730
No.

467
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,403
You can't die like this.

468
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,000
They're moving!

469
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,671
They're coming this way!

470
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,980
We should retreat.

471
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,774
This side is blocked as well.

472
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:56,076
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

473
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,996
<i>Please return to your quarters.</i>

474
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,000
<i>Otherwise you will be eliminated
from the game.</i>

475
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,167
No. Don't!

476
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,503
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

477
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:12,259
<i>All players, it is bedtime now.</i>

478
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,095
<i>Please return to your quarters.</i>

479
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,263
<i>Otherwise...</i>

480
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,931
Let's surrender.

481
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,225
We need to survive somehow.

482
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,652
<i>Advance team, do you copy?</i>

483
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,363
<i>We're out of ammo.</i>

484
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,449
<i>We're surrendering.</i>

485
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,094
Please don't kill--

486
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,021
Please don't kill me.

487
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,231
My daughter is very sick.

488
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,235
I surrender.

489
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,350
Player 456.

490
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,066
Did you have fun playing the hero?

491
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,284
Look closely

492
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,205
at the consequences
of your little hero game.

493
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,295
Gi-hun.

494
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,100
No!

495
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,090
